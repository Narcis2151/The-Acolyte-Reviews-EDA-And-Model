" Painful - how can it get this bad?
",2024-06-10,"Take one of the most exciting and expansive fictional universes with iconic characters and storylines... then just tear it up without respect to its original mythos, lore, etc. That's the path of destruction that Disney has been on, save Andor, Rogue One, and to an extent, the Mandalorian.It's sad because I'm sure lots of talented professionals worked on this. Tragically, the writing and acting is truly terrible. Special effects are great, but that's not enough to compensate for all its other flaws.As a fan, I want to give it zero stars. Out of respect for the special effects artists, I'm giving 3.",3.0
" This is laughably bad writing & direction
",2024-06-05,"Who in the holy hell read these scripts and said ""yeah these are great, definitely don't need to rewrite the entire thing""This is insulting, the characters have less IQ points than midicholorians. They have entirely abandoned the crawls, the aesthetic, the grit. Everything is shiny & new (even after fight scenes) and some of the Jedi are foaming at the mouth to fight whipping out their sabers every single time they walk into a room. The audience learns so little about the main cast of characters to care about the threat they are facing as they are left scratching their heads over how ignorant the decisions being made by the characters are spare a few.There is one point someone is being held by the force, and moments later needs to be caught, they are cornered 2-1 by 2 Jedi (and they are unarmed while Jedi are not), but have held this character moments before using the force, the villain character drops a smoke bomb (they blow the dust up from their feet) and gets away. The Jedi look on in bewilderment .The first two episodes feel rushed, badly, BADLY written, and leave audiences very little to desire a return to this part of a galaxy far, far away.",3.0
" What happened to the $180 million it cost to film season one of The Acolyte.
",2024-06-09,"Then I've seen episode one and two of The Acolyte.Eight episodes at $180 million or $22.5 million per episode. In terms of production, I get the impression of a cheap 80s science fiction, there was nothing here that would indicate $22.5 million per episode.Roger Corman could have made both of these episodes in the 80s for less than $100,000 each. When I have seen the first two episodes of The Acolyte, I get a cheap feeling of a bad and cheap CW production which in recent years has often had a bad script, bad actors and a low budget.Among the actors, Lee Jung-jae was in a class of his own, otherwise there was a lot of stiff and poor acting from some of the actors, which can often be caused by bad directing.Plot, script and dialogue were often unforgivably bad and stupid and are totally illogical. I don't understand how it is possible to write such bad scripts as we see in some TV series and movies nowadays. Has anyone at Disney approved the script before it goes into production?I wasn't a big fan of Ahsoka, all the senators and generals were stupid and inept to such an extent that I sided with the Empire.However, Ahsoka was much better with better actors and it was more grandiose and magnificent with many more and better effects and seemed like a much more expensive production.",3.0
" Jar Jar Binks was a museum masterpiece next to this
",2024-06-13,"Meesa no lika dis doodoo.I mean seriously what were they thinking? Have they even watched what they produced?? The acting and writing are horrible they have completed destroyed this franchise! I mean come on it isnt hard to make entertaining star wars there are 1000's of stories surrounding this universe..They could just copy the story of The Old Republic and have the most successful modern day star wars story with this production budget. But Nope. Seems they think they can do better with some teenage soap opera. Do they even have a passion for Star Wars? And even if its to recover the cost of purchasing the license, you can't even milk the franchise with such low quality efforts...I do not recommend watching this, you will have a much better time putting Jar jar binks scenes on loop for 3 hours instead of watching the 3 currently released episodes...",1.0
" Complete garbage
",2024-06-12,"I tried to give this series a chance but after 3 episodes, I'm done. It's absolute hot garbage. I love Star Wars but Disney is ruining the franchise. The producer should never get another gig after this. What made anybody think people would want to watch this? Horrible acting, horrible plot that nobody will care about unless you like after school specials. So much material they could choose from and they choose to make a WB type TV show. This could be the breaking point for many Star Wars fans. I can't believe they spent 180 million on this series that only a small percentage of fans will even finish. I would give it zero stars if I could.",1.0
" I made an account just to rate this junk
",2024-06-12,"That's right, I didn't have an account until this morning but had to create one so I could warn everyone to stay away from this junk. Banging your head on the wall would be a better use of your time than watching this. Episode 3 was awful. After watching I quickly got my VCR out and watched the Holiday Special from the late 70s so I could feel good about Star Wars again. Yes, it was that bad. I was longing for Bea Arthur and Harvey Korman to show up and save this show. Witches? Seriously? The Wicked Witch from the West was more enjoyable than these ""witches"". I don't get it, all the money they spend and they can't hire anyone with any talent to come up with something creative, or at least interesting. Boring, uncreative, lame storyline, nothing new or original, just the same old story lines. EXTREMELY disappointed, no reason to keep Disney+ any more. Can it get any worse?",1.0
" Cultural Vandalism
",2024-06-13,"I have never left a one star review for anything before. I always think the writing and production are never bad enough to be one star.This series completely warrants a one star.The writing is awful. Wooden dialogue, boring characters and so far a terrible plot. The whole production looks naff.I am open to change and new concepts. The franchise can't grow with the same stories and ideas being replayed. The Mandolorian, Ahsoka and Andor have demonstrated that you can come up with new ideas, characters and plot lines that enhance the franchise. What the producers of this series have managed to do is spend an ungodly amount of money on producing utter garbage. Episode 3 is the worst episode of any show I have ever watched. D&D must be relieved that their butchery of Game of Thrones ending is nothing compared to this.We all want new Star Wars material. But we want it done in a way that honours the original films and captures the essence of what makes the franchise so great.Anyone who signed off on this project should be sacked with immediate effect.",1.0
" Garbage
",2024-06-05,I'm a huge star wars fan and I can already tell whoever created this has no respect for the Star Wars Universe. Who said the Jedi only pull their weapons when ready to kill ? And if this girl is Sith than she is dumb to just approach one on a bar. This director us obviously misinformed and doesn't know anything about Star Wars. This show will ruin everything if it continues. It needs to be canceled. I have to write so many words to explain my distaste for this show so I will provide more. The characters are weak and none of them show Jedi traits. Let's just bring back the cartoons so we can see how Star Wars is supposed to be done.,
" A Solid Entry in the Franchise
",2024-06-24,"The Acolyte is a mystery thriller show set within the Star Wars universe. It focuses on two sisters who take different paths in life and centres around an Assassin who is attempting to kill Jedi.At the time of me writing this review there have been four episodes released. Each episode I've seen, I've enjoyed quite a bit. While this show is by no means a masterpiece, it's an enjoyable watch that adds to the lore of this ever-expanding universe of the Star Wars canon.I particularly like the characters of Sol and Mae in particular. And each week as a new layer of the mystery is peeled back, I've enjoyed theorising about what is going to happen next every time I finish an episode.The show suffers somewhat from a short run time, however. Episodes are typically 30-40 minutes long and having such a small and incomplete view of the overall story can feel frustrating. However, I don't think this makes the show bad, in fact it leaves me wanting more all the time.I do hope this show finishes strong and I may or may not update my review to reflect the show as a whole when it completes, but so far it has been an enjoyable watch that keeps you guessing even when you think you've worked it all out.",8.0
" The power of 1
",2024-06-13,"The power of 2, the power of many!Doesn't really get much worse than this, changing the lore of the force, destroying what many have tried to do by adding a new branch of witches chanting? Doesn't really make any sense and makes Anakin Skywalker's birth seem unimpressive.What this tv show feels like it's really meant to do is change starwars to something that just doesn't make sense. The storyline feels nonsensical, from the poisoning scene, to being stabbed with a little knife, nothing is making sense. I won't bother after 3 episodes I've definitely seen enough and recommend everyone to just watch something else!",1.0
" Star Wars: A New Low
",2024-06-05,"I'll set the tone for this review: in the first ten minutes of episode 1, the lead character used an extinguisher to put out a fire... in the vacuum of space.Yes, the writing is that imbecilic, and there's no signs of it improving by the end of episode 2. The problem with dumb writers is that you get dumb characters. That's how the story progresses, characters making inexplicable assumptions and illogical judgments as blatant devices to drive a bewildering plot forwards.The series really doesn't feel as though it is part of the Star Wars franchise. The producers seem to be smitten with the Matrix, not George Lucas' legacy.If you have expectations of a low budget sci-fi kung fu show that feels like fan fiction created by 13 year olds, you won't be disappointed.The other notable observation I had was that all the characters feel so revoltingly weak. They exhude incompetence. They are soft, squishy, useless people with zero gravitas, authority or nobility. If it were a series about hairdressers, fine. But as Jedi knights and force wielding assassins, a hard ""no"".The sole purpose of this series seems to be one giant DEI reach-around for the identity politics minority. Yeah, I'm sure that anyone who objects to extreme politicization in what should be fan entertainment will be prejudiced as a '..phobe' or an '..ist'. Narcissism does not permit people to acknowledge their failings.I've been a Star Wars fan since watching episode 4 in the cinema as a kid. I even thought Ashoka was okay. This is the end of the line for me.",1.0
" I would not recommend this to my worst enemy
",2024-06-13,"From a creative standpoint and the way the lore is being disrespected, I cannot with good faith recommend this to my worst enemy. This cannot be canon to the Star Wars franchise. The writing is lackluster, the virtue signaling is unnecessary and the visuals are not even remotely pleasing. The only part I could kind of give props to is the action scenes but even then is only a small part of what is really just a giant dumpster fire.I would rather watch the original trilogy and the animated series of stars wars. Even the video games are much better than this series. I really hope the producers and writers can do better and create something that values their core audience instead of sending a message.",1.0
" Literally Harry Potter was more Star Wars than this nonsense
",2024-06-22,"I can't remember whether it was the lead actress, or the former assistant of Harvey W who said this in a recent intervew, but it is very telling isn't it - ""We intentionally hired everyone working on this project who isn't a Star Wars fan""
Yes, we can tell. What more needs to be said? What can be the intent of such a deliberate choice? It certainly isn't to make a Star Wars show to entertain and inspire Star Wars fans.The people currently in control of the disney reboot masquerading as Star Wars (and doing a terrible job of it), aim to take and warp it, to destroy what Star Wars was what we the fans love about it. They hate Star Wars and they hate us, the fans. They have made it very clear over and over.My recommendation, for those who wish to love and enjoy Star Wars again - stop wasting your precious time on this. It is beneath all of us. Instead go to a nearby second hand book shop and pick up some Star Wars books and comics from before the reboot. 2014 and older. There you will find the characters you fell in love with, and many new ones who are undoubtedly their equals. That is where true Star Wars lives.MTFBWY.",1.0
" Did they?
",2024-06-14,"Did any of the producers / directors ever actually WATCH the original Star Wars trilogy? I'm so confused by this snore fest. There's no connection to canon, I don't care about these characters AT ALL. Is this supposed to attract female viewers (like me?} because if that was the aim, it's a monumental fail. You know what attracts females to Star Wars? Same thing that attracts men....good writing. Is that so incredibly difficult? Do these writers even put ""interesting storyline"" in their top 10 goals for a script? This is just yet another insult to Star Wars crammed with obvious messaging and void of anything else. I'm so sick of it and canceled D+ today because of this series.",
" Who is this for?
",2024-06-13,"I'm just baffled who this series is aimed at? I get that reinvention is a good thing, but the conflicting and contradictory nature of so much of this show seems almost designed to annoy people that like Star Wars. Is the play here that they are trying to alienate the current fan base and instead find a large new audience? I really don't think this can possibly work. It's really starting to feel like just making something people that like Star Wars would actually watch is something they are actively trying to avoid.It's kind of depressing on so many levels. It's now starting to feel like the brand that Star Wars was is just not what they want Star Wars to be. When I think about the endless stories they could make instead, that would not exclude new audiences and still excite old audiences, it's just bizarre how we end up here. With such a middling show that seems to be made for an imaginary audience.I guess the good thing about trying to alienate an audience is that eventually all of us feeling disappointment and then writing about, it will just stop caring anymore so there will be less people complaining. Maybe that's what Disney want?",4.0
" Star Wars writers should know...Star Wars?
",2024-06-06,"Episode 1 was hard to watch. Writing on this series so far is at the CW level, and toward the low end of that. The casting, or miscasting perhaps, is baffling. The lead looks too young for the character she portrays, and lacks seriously in presence. The character isn't interesting to boot. What was the thinking behind assigning her this acting task? Other characters suffer from the same mismatch problems. It's as if the characters and their actors were drawn out of a hat.Onto other issues. Dialog is clunky. As an example during a fight, one character asks another why they are there. Answer: to kill you. If killing with excess cringe were STAR WARS canon, this would be a dangerous weapon for THE ACOLYTE.Kung-fu action is another main theme for this series. Why? It doesn't look like STAR WARS. Could we get some explanation why the fighting style is suddenly front and center?In sum, THE ACOLYTE is a poorly written mess out the gate, and it suffers from an apparent general lack of understanding in regard to the STAR WARS universe. Overall showrunning on this one is poor.",3.0
" Weak writing, poor acting
",2024-06-22,"Bad Dialogue: Lines that feel forced or unnatural, lacking the wit or emotional weight the situation demands. Super CringeFlat Delivery by Actors: Performances that fail to convey emotions or connect with the audience.Singing Witches:Unfitting Singing Style: The music or singing style might clash with the overall Star Wars atmosphere.Poor Execution: The singing itself might be off-key, awkward, or lack emotional impact.Unnecessary Inclusion: Some viewers might feel singing adds nothing to the story and disrupts the flow.How did Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi appear in a story before he was born?",1.0
" The Acolyte: A Final Breath for Star Wars
",2024-06-14,"""The Acolyte"" represents a disappointing addition to the Star Wars franchise. The overwhelming number of negative reviews left here should tell you all you need to know about this dumpster fire of a show. The scarcity of positive reviews further underscores the series' shortcomings. Notably, many negative reviews are heavily voted down, yet there are very few positive reviews to counter them. This disparity highlights the overall lack of enthusiasm and support for the series, leaving us, the Star Wars fans underwhelmed and frustrated at what might be the final breath in our beloved Star Wars journey.",
" Was really hoping for better
",2024-06-21,"I just finished watching The Acolyte and the first word that comes to mind is disappointing. I was really hoping for better. I'm a Star Wars fan so I was really looking forward to this. I do admit that the visuals here are incredible. The acting wasn't horrible either, it's the writing that's bad which seems like the ongoing issue with these Star Wars shows, except for The Mandalorian which was great. When the writing is this bad then it doesn't matter who the actors are or how good the show looks because it's still a bad show. Hopefully this will get better if they do another season but I'm not counting on it.",1.0
" One of the worst shows I've ever seen.
",2024-06-19,"I created an account specifically to share my thoughts on ""Star Wars: The Acolyte,"" and unfortunately, I must say that this is one of the worst shows I have ever seen.Firstly, the writing is exceedingly sloppy. The dialogue often feels contrived and unnatural, making it difficult to invest in the characters or their motivations.Speaking of the characters, the acting leaves much to be desired. Performances across the board are lackluster, with many actors delivering their lines without any real conviction or emotion. This contributes to a general sense of detachment from the story and its players.Moreover, the show's narrative structure is flawed. Pacing issues abound, with certain scenes dragging on unnecessarily while others that seem crucial to the plot are rushed or glossed over entirely. This disjointed approach makes it challenging to follow the storyline or feel any meaningful engagement.In terms of production, while the special effects and set designs are passable, they are not enough to salvage the show from its fundamental shortcomings. Visuals alone cannot compensate for the lack of substance in the writing and acting.Long story short this show is absolute trash. Do not watch.",1.0
" Have the writers ACTUALLY seen Star Wars??
",2024-06-13,"Holy mother of god. Get writers who ACTUALLY know and love Star Wars. SURELY IT CANT BE THAT HARD.This is just genuinely so painful and sad to watch. I don't know how they can have such success with Andor and turn around to make something like this.It's as if the writers have absolutely no knowledge of Star Wars lore and literally just heard the plot from a friend and are trying to make a series from that.Also, the acting is so subpar that it's just plain cringe. Maybe it's from the stilted dialogue? But surely there are better actors they could have pulled with that kind of a budget.Pain.",1.0
" Any fan could do it better.
",2024-06-11,"This rating and review is for the first episode (even Yoda wouldn't have the power to go through
the second episode.) people say you got to bring your A game on the first episode cause it will be the one who rooks the audience in, and will set the base for the whole show.The first episode of this show is so dumb and badly written, nobody in the creative/writing team know anything about Star Wars and to makes things worst they haven't seen any critic, memes or jokes about the Disney shows they already have, they made so lightsabers can't kill force users, but now knives can? The Jedi death scene was one of the worst things I've seen ever, you know how you fill bad when a character is so dumb or does something so stupid that you have to change the channel or just turn off, you will feel this through the whole episode about the writing in this show, the feeling to just quit because it can't really be serious, this shows was not proof read nor audience tested, I remember a time when Netflix became a joke cause people thought that any idea anyone sent there was made into a show and I think that's exactly what Disney is doing with it's IPs, there is nobody in charge.Bob, Kathleen and Walt's descendants next time any of you decide to throw money away just send it to me, I will use it in a better way.",2.0
" Agenda filled mess
",2024-06-10,"Bad, predictable Plot, poor Character writing and weird pacing.""The Acolyte,"" the latest addition to the Star Wars universe by Leslie Headland, is a colossal disappointment. The plot is painfully predictable, following a tired and uninspired storyline that does little to engage viewers. It's clear that the show is more focused on ticking boxes for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion than on crafting a compelling narrative. This forced agenda overshadows any potential the show might have had, resulting in a contrived and unconvincing storyline.The pacing in the first two episodes is dreadful, dragging along without any real momentum. The fight choreography is stiff and overly choreographed, making action scenes feel forced and unexciting. The characters are one-dimensional, with every male character portrayed as dumb and incompetent, a blatant attempt to undermine them rather than create strong, multifaceted female characters.The show's attempt to be progressive comes off as pandering, and the lack of depth in its characters and story is glaringly obvious. ""The Acolyte"" feels more like a box-ticking exercise than a genuine addition to the Star Wars lore. If you're looking for a captivating and thrilling Star Wars experience, this isn't it. Save yourself the time and skip this poorly executed mess.",2.0
" I Know Kung Fu
",2024-06-06,"Two episodes in and all I can think about is how much this series seems to have ripped off scenes from The Matrix. Having Carrie-Anne Moss effectively play Trinity again but dressed in a Jedi robe was bizarre and ridiculous.The martial arts direction they appear to be trying to take for this series' action scenes makes for a strange and jarring choice. Even the non-Jedi characters seem to be experts in kung fu. It doesn't feel like Star Wars at all.Much of the dialogue sounds flat, as if it were straight from a high school drama production.I laughed hard at the scenes with Torbin, a levitating Jedi master, in the second episode. The makeup department takes a very young actor and gives him a terrible fake beard and receding hairline to make him look like an old man. It looks like something from an SNL sketch.Overall, the show is generally uninteresting and at times laughable. This is the reason I will probably watch to the end, just to see how bad it gets.So, it falls into the 'so bad it's good' category but I'm not sure that what the creators were going for.",3.0
" The final nail in the coffin.
",2024-06-10,Hope is not or else this is the final nail in the coffin for me regarding Star Wars future shows. Give up after watching the initial pilot episodes. How can someone even imagine coming out with such a lousy show. Total waste of time watching this ridiculously uninspired new series. Show start right off with scripts taken right off the typical Martial arts movie and then ended up with all kind of weird plots as if the producers were too lazy to think and just let AI to generate the script. By now I am truly convince that the top brass in Disney will not continue to stop destroying whatever is still left of our beloved Star Wars memories.,1.0
" Not worth your time
",2024-06-13,"Much better productions to watch. Just so bad now. The Acolyte storyline & characters unengaging or poorly developed. The plot lacks coherence, characters fall flat and underdeveloped, and the pacing is off, a uneventful overall viewing experience. Additionally, the technical aspects like poor special effects, uninspired cinematography, and weak dialogue also contributes to it being a poor series to spend time on. Disney has failed its fans with this latest release. Poor choices for actors and their characters. Its a shame that this has happened and what an insult to Mr. George Lucas who let this go years ago. He should acquire it back asap.",1.0
" So far the most disappointing SW series ever
",2024-06-13,"After three episodes I really don't know where to start. Good things: it's in Star Wars Universe (at least it should be) Carrie-Anne Moss was also very classy in the beginning and I was glad to see her performing so well. But that's it then about the good things. It went so quickly for the 5 star dinner into the fast food department. The story is just childish and makes not much sense. Actors mediocre at their best. Nothing new nor interesting aspects in the show. I don't know what's the target audience, at least it's not made for the Star Wars fans at all. Light years behind Andor, Mandalorian and others.",

" A Script Doctor and Ghostwriter's take on the Acoylte
",2024-06-12,"As a former working script doctor and ghostwriter, my advice to the writing team, read ""Save the Cat"" and their beat sheet on ""A New Hope."" The beat sheet highlights the hero's journey.The Acolyte's inciting incident is not even in the series. The inciting incident is actually all the films and books that came before. The series is counting on us on being hooked on Star Wars. That is what propels us to watch. That is the inciting incident. In an attempt to be all inclusive it excludes the most important thing of all, the Star Wars lore, the history and continuity.Stop forcing exposition, diversity, and show don't tell. It's okay to have a story that explores social themes if done right. Don't tell the audience what we need to feel. Show us and the emotion will come naturally.",1.0
" What have they done to my favourite franchise?
",2024-06-13,"Star Wars is about leaving your own reality and entering a magical Star Wars universe that got me and many others so excited since the 80s (in my case). This is not Star Wars. I don't know what it is. It's an absolute disgrace that these creators are making a living from ruining something that used to be so perfect. I hope this is the breaking point for the current creators. That's the only positive I can derive from this absolute mess!

" The worst Star Wars project since the Holiday Special.
",2024-06-07,"Quite literally the worst Star Wars project since the Holiday Special. It actively changes the Star Wars universe, the nature of the Force, and all of the canon that has come before. It's straight garbage, written by people with no respect for the franchise, and directed by people with no capability of creating a TV show. It's profoundly senseless.Poorly written, poorly acted, poorly edited, and poorly paced. The entire show appears to be little more than a vanity project full of self-inserts rather than real characters. The decisions made by the characters don't make sense and break immersion constantly. The concepts introduced seem to be little more than whims, with no reasoning behind them and no explanation as to why they don't line up with franchise canon.The idea behind the story may be decent, but the writer/showrunner is far too vain and inept to give it a proper attempt.",2.0
" Really?
",2024-06-12,"I am sorry, but episode 3 has some of the worst story telling and writing I have ever seen. That tiny fire caused ALL of that damage and the acting was so hard to watch.

This is a boring and pointless show. I feel sorry for everyone involved, I am sure a lot of effort and hours went into making this show, but Disney needs to get things together. This is not want the majority of Star Wars fans want. If you like this show that's awesome, I am glad you like it but it's not for me.",1.0
" Sad to see that it's HORRIBLE
",2024-06-12,Starwars has continued to make new shows that are very entertaining. However the acolyte takes Ali's back 100 years before the fall of the republic which is quite neat. All this to say some how Disney scribed it up. The show has extremely poor writing and an uninteresting sorry. Not to mention the story has a contradiction ever 2 minutes. There is no build up and Disney some how expects us to become. Attached with the characters. Besides all of that the show just gives an unlikable vibeThis rating is made 3 episodes in so it may change.The positives: I really like how starwars decided to go back in time rather than continuing to go fowardI love the costume designs.,2.0
" Anyone rating this excrement over 1 is A.I.
",2024-06-23,Barely able to understand who is writing this series. The amount of money spent on each episode means that a 5 year old with a tablet could do a better job. Going to rewatch the original movies to cleanse my thoughts of how Disney messed up another franchise.Since I have to write more to post I will say I was very disappointed on how they developed the story. The characters are so stupid and they have no relevance to any storyline from anything written. If you have watch it turn the sound off and create you own story and find a way to connect it to anything Star Wars. You might even have a laugh.,
" SW fans will kill the franchise

The writing is juvenile but this series is marketed towards the YA audience. What are you expecting? This is not for the nerd who saw Star Wars in the theatre at age 7 and now wants a o relive that impossible magic. You are never going to get it so grow up and just accept you will never be 7 years old again. This is a series with limited budget that shows with YA writing, it shows. I'm mildly entertained but I'm in my 40's. It's not for me. At least it's Old Republic and they are expanding the universe finally giving us Jedi policing the galaxy and using the force.

" Absolute JUNK!
",2024-06-12,"What a load of $#%#! This series is the worst on planet earth. What is Disney thinking??!! How about giving us a show that concentrates on pure entertainment. The script, acting and directing is the worst you'll ever see. 0 / 10. Scrap this junk immediately. A complete dumpster fire!!!Star Wars under Disney and Kathleen Kennedy is dead. She's totally wrecked the whole universe, the characters and anything that makes sense. The Acolyte really shows how far they have plummeted and just produce junk without any care.

" Feels like something a teen would come up with
",2024-06-05,"To keep the review simple, the characters' behavior and the story they try to tell in these first two episodes feel bland. It feels as if it would be a sketch done by a pre-teen redrawn together by great visual artists.The show does look and feel great. The environment is well put together as is the CGI.Events seem to happen somewhat randomly only to forcefully push the story forward or to trigger some sort of emotion without any particular setup or explanation.The characters feel like they would be part of the Jedi world, but they behave so poorly as trained Jedi masters.On the other hand, it could be a story about how the Jedi order has been slacking and degrading due to them having taken over the galaxy and being in control for so long at the point in time where the show takes place.But I doubt they thought so far considering what we've seen in these first two episodes. Let's see the rest of the show.",4.0
" Major Letdown
",2024-06-13,"""The Acolyte,"" a recent addition to the Star Wars universe, falls disappointingly short on multiple fronts. Despite the high expectations that typically accompany any new Star Wars content, this show fails to deliver on almost every aspect.The production value, usually a hallmark of the Star Wars franchise, is surprisingly subpar in ""The Acolyte."" The set designs and special effects often appear lackluster and unconvincing, undermining the immersive experience that fans have come to expect. The visual elements feel more like a forced attempt to capture the magic of the Star Wars universe rather than a genuine extension of it.Casting is another area where ""The Acolyte"" stumbles. The actors seem miscast, and there is a noticeable lack of chemistry among the main characters. This disconnect makes it difficult to become invested in their journeys or care about their fates. Furthermore, the performances are generally uninspired, with many of the actors delivering their lines in a flat, disengaged manner that fails to bring any depth or nuance to their characters.The script is perhaps the most significant letdown of all. The dialogue is often stilted and cliché, lacking the wit and charm that has characterized some of the best Star Wars entries. The plot feels disjointed and poorly paced, with numerous scenes that seem to drag on without adding meaningful development to the story or characters. Instead of a coherent and compelling narrative, ""The Acolyte"" offers a muddled series of events that struggle to hold the viewer's attention.Overall, ""The Acolyte"" is a disappointing addition to the Star Wars saga. From its unimpressive production values to its lackluster casting and weak script, there is little to recommend. For fans looking for a new and exciting chapter in the Star Wars universe, this show is likely to be a letdown.",2.0

The destruction of the Star Wars legacy continues with yet another sub standard written prequel. As a star wars fan I can't get behind this one. The writing is weak, the plot is predictable. Its like a poorly made fan film made by people with a surface level understanding of Star Wars. This show was given every opportunity to be good. Star Wars in an earlier era, 180 million dollars, and plenty of time to make it. It is really sad to see what Disney has done to Star Wars. Goodbye Star Wars, goodbye Disney.",1.0
" Disney Failed again
",2024-06-05,"Disney's latest foray into the Star Wars saga, ""The Acolyte,"" is a disappointing addition that fails to live up to its potential. Despite its ambitious premise, the series stumbles in almost every aspect, making it a frustrating watch as a Star wars fan.First and foremost, the storytelling in ""The Acolyte"" is a mess. The plot feels disjointed and poorly paced, with episodes dragging on without meaningful progression. Instead of building a cohesive narrative, the series opts for a convoluted storyline that leaves you more confused than intrigued. The characters, who should be the heart of any Star Wars story, are underdeveloped and lack depth. Their motivations while clear, however their actions often seem inexplicable, making it hard to care about their fates. Just aweful.The dialogue is another major issue. It's riddled with clichés and uninspired lines that fail to capture the epic feel of the Star Wars universe. Moments that should be filled with tension and drama instead come across as flat and lifeless. The series also tries to inject humor inappropriately, breaking any semblance of immersion.Visually, ""The Acolyte"" is a mixed bag. While some of the special effects are impressive, they can't compensate for the lackluster set designs and uninspired cinematography. The series does little to explore new and exciting worlds, instead rehashing familiar settings without adding anything fresh or innovative. Worse still, the entire production feels like a low-budget endeavor. The costumes look cheap, the practical effects are lackluster, and many scenes lack the polish one would expect from a major franchise like Star Wars.The cast, despite their best efforts, struggle with the material they are given. Talented actors are wasted on poorly written characters and uninspired dialogue, resulting in performances that feel wooden and unengaging. The chemistry between the leads is virtually nonexistent, further diminishing the series' emotional impact.In conclusion, ""The Acolyte"" is a missed opportunity for Disney and the Star Wars franchise. It lacks the compelling narrative, strong characters, and captivating visuals that fans have come to expect. Instead of expanding the Star Wars universe in meaningful ways, it feels like a hollow, forgettable addition. The low-budget feel only exacerbates its shortcomings, making it hard to recommend ""The Acolyte."" Save your time and look elsewhere for your sci-fi fix.",3.0
" I've got a bad feeling about this...
",2024-06-10,"Bad script, bad casting, bad acting, and bad directing. Bad Disney.My caveat: I could only make it through the first episode and a few minutes of the second one before I threw in the towel. So, it is possible - albeit extraordinarily unlikely - that it gets better. That said, I won't watch any more of it.I can't help thinking that someone pitched the show as a project unrelated to Star Wars and it was rejected by every studio. Disney then said to the writer, ""What if you change the king fu master to a Jedi and we say it's part of the Star Wars universe?"" The writer replied, ""What's Star Wars?"" and Disney said, ""Sold!""If Disney is wise, they will yank it down and pretend it never happened, like the Star Wars Christmas special.P. S. Despite this, I have not given up on Disney's Star Wars yet, and will hope the next series will be more Andor and less Acolyte.",2.0
" high production value, but cringe and horrible dialogue
",2024-06-05,"There are a two positive traits here. The production value is (mostly) high, and as always with star wars the sound design and music score is great.Sadly the money spent on making this (mostly) look and sound good is also the only positives.From the very start the dialogue is so cringe inducing I was almost throwing up. This feels like it has been written by a 9yo fangirl of Darth Kennedy. Some tiny little girl, filled with hatred of star wars and loathing of Star Wars fans, became the acolyte of Kathleen Kennedy and was then given hundreds of millions to put her incoherent thoughts down as a TV show. That is what this feels like.The story, as far is there is one, is likewise confusing and make little to no sense. The acting is so poor I can only deduce they found these ""actors"" (I use the term very loosely) in a parking lot at KFC.And on this show we get a fire in space. Yes, so that happened... And then we got a fire that burns from stone, burning down a mountain... what the.... I don't think the showrunners know how even fire works.This is so bad, so badly done, so badly acted, so cringe, that when you see this surrounded by high production value your brain goes tilt. There is a disconnect and weird feeling coming over you. How did this become made? And who green-lit throwing this much money at someones hateful school play?I give an extra point for the production value and sound design, plus I could not help myself laughing at the bad acting and cringe dialogue. Laughter is always nice. But 2/10 do feel like a too high score.This is really bad TV, with the worst acting ever seen on this level. If you like star wars, stay away from this disaster. And if you do watch leave your cringe-o-meter at home because it will explode because this is super cringe. Your spine will crackle and your eyes will explode cringe.",2.0
" Solid start, could go either way

Some promising performances and fight scenes that show the potential of where this show could go. It brings a lot of questions to the forefront that the show will seek to answer over this first season, and I'm intrigued by the possibilities. Ignore the reviews that speak of political ideology, because it objectively features no politics of any kind.My guess would be that most of these negative reviews came from individuals whose minds were made up when the trailers first debuted. Ignore them, and frankly ignore mine, too. Go into this with an open and undecided mind. If you don't like it, fine. Not everything works for everyone and that's the way it goes.

" most juvenile Star Wars ever
",2024-06-06,This is by far the most juvenile and boring Star Wars show ever. The story felt like it was written by a teenager for kids. Disney really should have stopped at Obi Wan and quit. The acting and casting are just obviously amateurish. And the showed started with Kung fu fighting like in the matrix and that is just a new low for Star Wars stories. The casting of the lead actress felt really forced. The story is made up of old and tired cliches. It is nothing more than a murder show involving Jedi and space stuff. It is hard to finish the first episode and I will pass on the subsequent episodes as I got better things to do such as talking to my cat.,1.0

The characters have fewer IQ points than midichlorians, and the essence of Star Wars is utterly abandoned. The iconic crawls are gone, the gritty aesthetic is replaced with everything shiny and new, and the Jedi act more like untrained novices, drawing their sabers at the slightest provocation.The main cast is so poorly developed that the audience is left scratching their heads, unable to care about the threats they face due to the characters' ignorant decisions. For example, in one scene, a character is held by the Force but later needs to be caught, cornered 2-to-1 by two armed Jedi. Despite this, the villain escapes by dropping a smoke bomb, leaving the Jedi looking on in bewilderment.The first two episodes are rushed, horrendously written, and give viewers no reason to return to this part of a galaxy far, far away.""",1.0
" The end is near
",2024-06-13,"The Acolyte, the latest installment in the Star Wars franchise, is a devastating blow to the fandom. It completely misses the essence that made Star Wars a cultural phenomenon. The characters are shallow, the plot is incoherent, and the series seems to prioritize ticking boxes over crafting a compelling story. It's disheartening to see beloved lore mishandled so badly. The pacing is inconsistent, and the dialogue often feels forced and unnatural, lacking the wit and charm that once defined Star Wars. The decisions made in this show seem out of touch with what fans have cherished for decades. The Acolyte might be the final nail in the coffin for long-time fans, leaving us with a lingering sadness and a fear that Star Wars may never recover from this low point. Watching this show feels like witnessing the end of an era, one where the magic and excitement of Star Wars have been replaced by mediocrity and disillusionment. It's a harsh reminder that even the most beloved franchises can falter, and sadly, it seems Star Wars has reached an all-time low with The Acolyte.",1.0

" Another Disney Ruined Franchise
",2024-06-05,"While ""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" has been a highly anticipated addition to the Star Wars universe, the first two episodes have unfortunately fallen short of expectations for some viewers. Here's a critical take on the series thus far:The Acolyte: A Missed Opportunity in a Galaxy Far, Far AwayFrom the onset, ""The Acolyte"" promised a fresh perspective, set a century before the events of ""The Phantom Menace"" and delving into the unexplored High Republic era. However, the series has so far delivered a narrative that feels all too familiar, echoing the same beats and tropes that have been well-trodden by its predecessors.The opening episodes introduce us to a galaxy in turmoil, with a mysterious figure targeting Jedi masters. While the premise is intriguing, the execution lacks the innovation and depth that could have set ""The Acolyte"" apart. The series, created and written by Leslye Headland, who also directed the first two episodes, stars a diverse and talented cast including Amandla Stenberg and Lee Jung-jae. Yet, their performances are hindered by a script that struggles to find its unique voice within the Star Wars canon.Critics have pointed out that the show's cinematography and dialogue often feel uneven, failing to match the initial excitement generated by its action-packed opening scene3. The fight choreography, while impressive, doesn't compensate for the lack of tension and stakes that are essential for a darker Star Wars tale.Looking ahead to the third episode, there is a promise of deepening the mystery with Mae's vendetta against the Jedi and the introduction of a Wookiee Jedi named Kelnacca4. However, there's a growing concern that ""The Acolyte"" may continue to rely on familiar storytelling patterns, potentially leading to a predictable and uninspiring continuation of the saga.In conclusion, while ""The Acolyte"" boasts an excellent cast and a premise ripe for exploration, it needs to break free from the shadow of the Skywalker saga and chart its own course. Otherwise, it risks being remembered as a mere echo of the stories that came before, rather than a standout chapter in the expansive Star Wars narrative.",2.0
" The writing
",2024-06-08,"Is so beyond terrible and not only that it feels like the people that made this have never watched star wars. Disney taking ownership of star wars was the worst thing that ever happened to it. The only new one I kind of liked was the one with Adam Driver in it. Heck I wasn't even a huge fan of the original star wars, so It's not like I have a huge fan bias. I'm more into Star Trek.My bar when it comes to sci fiction is extremely low. I don't need great CGI and the actors don't need to be perfect. I just want a well written and though out show. Did all the good writers for shows and movies die out not long ago?",
" Solid start

This is first live action attempt in the Disney era that is removed from the Skywalker Era and it's a refreshing to watch a Star Wars story that doesn't need a ""I remember him"" moment to cary the story.The first two episodes are a slow burn, so I'll reserve final judgment when the entire series is over, but it's excellent start and something different from the normal Star Wars fair. I suspect Star Wars who aren't obsessed with politics will enjoy it.",8.0
" A dumpster fire burning in space
",2024-06-10,"10 Things I hated about The Acolyte:1) Matrix style kung-fu fighting. Why is there kung-fu in my Star Wars universe? This isn't the matrix. In a fight between force users why would a force user bother with hand to hand combat when you have a lightsaber, and the force to just grab someone and subdue them? Makes no sense at all.2) Twins that have grown up for years separately have the exact same braided hair, cut in the exact same fashion, and have the exact same body dimensions as each other. How is this possible? Kids go through many hairstyles in the course of a life, especially during their teenage, and post teenage years. One isn't fatter than the other, or more fit? Did they have the exact same diet, and workout routine, even though one is some dark force cult, and the other is a mechanic on space freighters?3) The droids have no verisimilitude to them, they look like plastic toys, or cheap made in China products. Believable looking droids has been a staple of Star Wars, these designs how the look, and function fall way short of the precedent set by the trilogy. They don't look real.4) Sedated guy in prison ship wakes up from whatever paralyzing affect the parasite on his face was doing to him, is instantly coherent and understanding of the situation, and bee lines to an escape pod to escape.5) One of the braid kids survives a crash landing space ship by merely wearing a seat belt. The seat, and seat belt she was using aren't even intact when we see that she survived the crash, yet she has no marks, scratches, or injuries from said crash.6) People on an ice planet wear short sleeves, and don't seem to notice the cold at all. Jedi knowingly go to an ice planet without even bothering to wear appropriate winter clothing. Also no frost mist comes out of anyone's mouth as they talk or breath, as would happen if the ice planet were actually cold.7) Operatives working with the Jedi pick up survivors that ejected from the prison ship prior to the crash, then bring them all the way back to Corescant to question them about the crash when they had to pick them up above the planet that the ship crashed on. What sense does that make? Why wouldn't you question, and investigate the crash while you were there?8) Also why would two Jedi, who have their own spacecraft leave the prime suspect accused of killing a force using Jedi in the hands of a robot security prison ship. If she was indeed the murderer, and had force abilities, why the hell wouldn't the Jedi transport her themselves. Why risk the chance of her using force powers to seize control of the prison ship and escape? So stupid.9) Also everything from the spaceships, to the locations, to the interiors, everything looks immaculate and fake. Nothing looks lived in, everything looks so clean that it looks like a set or some green screen created background. The show runner is obviously inept in that the worn look was one of the key things that made real Star Wars movies come alive, that these locations look like they could actually exist(Even the Andor show got this right). In this show, everything from the worlds, to the planet landscapes, to the ships everything looks like it's on a stage or a computer screen. Really breaks all immersion.10) Beyond those glaring insults to the audience's intelligence, there was the bad acting, bored actors, bad writing, bad dialogue, and a bad cliche ridden tired, and predictable story. The production value does not seem close to what was reportedly spent on this miserable excuse for a Star Wars product. I'm sure there were more bad to include that I missed, but I couldn't stomach watching it a second time. It's so bad that I couldn't even watch the second episode. This from a man who forced himself to endure every other Star Wars abomination created by Disney.Now for the good:
1) It was nice to see Carrie Anne Moss getting some of those Disney dollars without having to be in this long enough to hurt her career.In closing, this is where I draw the line. Star Wars is officially dead to me, I don't even care any longer. So that's something.There is so much awful in the Star Wars now, that it drowns out, and obscures the good that was made in the 70s and 80s. I guess Disney got it's wish, it's time to let the past die, and this series killed it because I guess they felt they had to.",1.0

",2024-06-16,"I'm actually impressed. The creators of The Acolyte have secured the dubious honour of having created one of the worst Star Wars adaptations - and shows in general - of all time. The writing and dialogue is abysmal, as is the direction of the plot so far (first three episodes). Also, science fiction requires *some* science for it to be believable. For example, how does no one making this show understand that sustained flames cannot exist in the vacuum of space? As for faithful adaptation of the Star Wars mythos, it fails because it introduces a completely different metaphysical concept that was never established by George Lucas, called ""The Thread."" At least with other adaptations by Disney, good or not, they actually stuck to the basic timeline and lore. I really don't understand what this is, as it's not Star Wars, nor is it really a sci-fi show. It's just an utter failure by a company that pushes their social and political messaging over competent and compelling storytelling.

This is the sound and fury of people that only care about the message and hate the art they are suppose to create. Whoever made this garbage hates Star Wars. Whoever approved this garbage hates Star Wars. These people are trash humans and I hope nothing but the worst for them.

" No stars.
",2024-06-19,"This show feels like it was written by a prepubescent spoiled child who makes every character greater than the originals just to win an argument. Anakin was the chosen one, unless you watch this show. Then Mae is the most powerful. Oh and they are also twins like Luke and Leia. Oh and Mae is more powerful than anyone. And these Jedi are more powerful than the prequel Jedi. One is so powerful he can't be touched. Except he is tired of life and drinks poison. The actors gave a good performance, but the shows direction is just trash. The whole goal of the antagonist Mae is to kill a Jedi without a weapon. Just reinforcing the idea of this character is better than anyone else. She is hunting Jedi masters and can kill them with little trouble?? Seriously? Well, except the one who is too powerful to touch, so he just drinks poison for reasons. The dark Jedi master is a bumbling idiot who is wandering with Mae. This smacks of the darth Jar Jar theory. Seriously Disney, do better or just stop.",
" Not as good as I hoped but better than the reviews will make you believe
",2024-06-05,"The first glaring thing is that it must said is that this show will obviously be review bombed by conservatives and the Fandom Menace crowd because it features a cast of mostly minorities despite it being the type of show this crowd has asked for for almost a decade.Besides this, to get to the substantive thoughts, for negative criticisms it has a lot of the standard Dissney Plus Star Wars problems where it looks a little off visually although it's definitely better looking than stuff like Mandalorian Season 3 and Ahsoka but not as good as Andor. It also falls into the standard Star Wars problem of some of the dialogue feeling kinda clunky which, some of it does.For positives, the story is interesting so far and I am excited to see where it leads, there's not much to go through when it comes to characters, there's not too much depth to them yet but it's done enough where I'm interested to see where the show goes after this and it has earned me tuning in.",7.0

For a show that is on track to spend seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars dollars for every minute, if these first episodes are any indication clocking in at approximately 30ish minutes of actual run time minus the four minute credits and opening, it looks and feels bad. I was expecting at least good production value. The CGI background set thing they have been using for years now has never looked so bad and is obviously fake. The Jedi are basically galactic CPS and makes no sense at all. The action choreography actually made me laugh out loud multiple times. Just a poor product so far.

Fire the writers, bring in Timothy Zahn to write a script, bring in Filoni or Favreau to take charge of this. This is Disney's holiday special equivalent, and I am wishing this was aired one time so we could forget this existed. The Ewok movies were better than this... very disappointing.

" Horrible Writing
",2024-06-15,"First two episodes ok, felt like it was written by chatgpt, but ok.This episode was so dumb that it made me not want to watch anymore. None of the plot made any sense. A group of ""witches"" say they use dark powers and were driven into exile, but when they encounter Jedi everyone is nice and polite to each other. Two sisters are extremely close but when one is about to leave the other suddenly says she'll kill her and tries to burn her to death. Seconds later they are both calling to each other like long lost friends as if no attempted murder just happened. In previous episodes Jedi were revealed to feel so guilty about some traumatic event that they'd commit suicide and exile themselves. In this episode the traumatic event is revealed to be... asking to train one of the sisters??? No Jedi did anything to directly harm or even threaten anyone. Makes the entire plot of the sister wanting revenge and Jedi feeling guilty complete nonsense. We see a sister fall hundreds of feet into an explosive inferno, but somehow she survives with just ash smudges on her cheeks, despite those same explosions killing an entire coven of powerful witches, including her mother who was apparently more powerful than even two other witches combined.Which comes to the witches chanting stupidly about the power of one, the power of two, and the power of many, and at no point showing what the power of two even is. The only example we get of the power of two involves it getting beaten by the power of one. So what are they chanting about? Their special ceremony involves harmonizing the combined power of the whole coven... to put a tattoo on a girl's forehead.And then of course there's the subversion of the entire Skywalker saga by the revelation that Anakin wasn't special, apparently these confused witches already created life from the force 100 years ago.Nothing in the episode makes sense either internally or within the star wars universe. None of the characters are developed to explain their sudden changes in motivation and drastic actions. The only key point of the episode seems to be a connection to real world identity politics as the witch leader declares that the galaxy doesn't have a place for women like them... and minutes later a female Jedi walks in as the leader of a Jedi squad, so the stupidity is unbounded. No interest in watching further episodes. Hopefully there's more Andor or another season of Mandalorian which actually focuses on the Mandalorian, because Disney is back to killing the Star Wars franchise.",1.0

Andor was souch better of a show. This is garbage. This show must only be getting views after this because of people who hear about how terrible it is and need to watch it to see if it's true. It's too bad those people will not be spared. So much of the story here isn't even making logical sense.

However, a small kunai to the chest is an instant death.A single eye witness can identify the murderer: a woman with dark skin, and braided hair. An eye witness... Because those are so reliable when horrible events occur around them like a murder, for example. There are no holocams anywhere? No DNA samples? Fingerprints even?? The witness is an alien too, can he even see the difference between humans? But mostly: SHE WORE A MASK!Because in thousands of worlds and literally billions upon billions of people, there is only one single person who fits the description ""dark skinned woman with braided hair"" in the entire universe, so they know exactly where to go.That person is busy putting out a fire. In the vacuum of space. Because in Star Wars nowadays, fire does no longer need oxygen to burn. Because midichlorians or something I guess.She is getting arrested, but instead of being taken with the jedi, she's put on a prison transport for some inexplicable reason. Despite having the most iron-clad, waterproof alibi ever possible, she is indeed treated as a prisoner, not a suspect.Transport is manned by a couple of droids, because what else would you do with hardened criminals and one innocent women? Get guards? Ha ha ha.Transport gets destroyed in a jail-break, escape pods are launched. Republic people find the escape pod with the other prisoners, and then GO BACK TO CORUSCANT to get other people to look for the suspect. So now the Jedi have to go allllll the way back there!In a scene that is literally ripped off from The Fugitive (a good movie starring Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones), suspect says ""I didn't do it,"" which immediately makes the Jedi chasing her go ""oh okay then, my bad, sorry.""Dark figure on cliff gives speech to suspect's evil twin (bet you didn't see that coming). And then, for no reason, lights a red lightsaber. There's ample light around. No threats of any kind. They clearly know each other. But I guess he's got some ADHD and can't help himself playing with it? Anyhoo, now we know he's a Sith. Bet you didn't see that coming either.This show has no redeeming qualities. The writing is the worst ever, and that's saying something after things like The Last Jedi, and the two shows I already mentioned, for example. The acting is bad too, and the fighting choreography feels like this was practiced in one single day.If you are a Star Wars fan: do not watch this drivel.

" Way to go, Leslye!
",2024-06-06,"Leslye Headland is absolutely spot on. Our whole perception of Star Wars has been incredibly off-mark. To think we cherished it as a saga that masterfully wove together elements of myth, complex morality, and the timeless struggle of light against darkness, within an expansive, meticulously crafted universe. How utterly quaint of us! It seems we've been utterly blind to its true essence: an intergalactic teenage fanfiction, brimming with self-insert characters who gallivant across the stars, unburdened by depth or growth.Why bother with the intricate dance of politics, the philosophical ponderings on the nature of power and responsibility, or the nuanced portrayal of humanity (and alien-ity) in all its complexity? Why invest in crafting a story that explores the delicate balances of the Force, when it's much simpler to pen down a universe that caters to the whims of adolescent fantasy? Forget the painstakingly constructed lore, the epic narratives that span generations, and the careful character development that has inspired millions across the globe. No, no, let's just reduce it all to a cosmic-scale teenage diary entry. After all, what value do themes of sacrifice, redemption, and the enduring hope in the face of overwhelming darkness have, when you can have your very own cosmic soap opera? Bravo, Leslye. Bravo.",

But with just 8 per season, every episode really counts, and I wish the character introduction to OSHA had better dialogue.

Andor was great because it wasn't trying to ram real world quandaries into the story. This isn't a representation of our world.

" Very Strong Start
",2024-06-05,"I wouldn't normally choose to rate a television show, certainly not this early, but of course because this is a piece of Star Wars media choosing to have a diverse cast of characters it has been targeted with negative one star reviews. I thought I'd provide my opinion as someone who doesn't care about character casting, but rather the quality of the show itself. I firmly believe that practically no show honestly deserves a one star review, especially when the show hasn't even come out yet (we were seeing an overwhelming amount of one star reviews come in hours before the two episodes released!) Well, I have seen them now and I can honestly say this is a very intriguing, solid start that it is setting up. With the beginning of anything, ESPECIALLY mysteries, it is impossible to tell the direction and momentum it will keep; but these first two episodes were filled with exhilarating mysteries and intriguing twists that could potentially set up something remarkable. Let's hope that comment ages like wine rather than milk! If you are coming into it expecting something on the level of The Mandalorian you might be disappointed. While it is a strong start, at times it can feel cliché. If you are coming into this with a negative anchoring bias you will find plenty of things to dislike. But at the same time some of those clichés are what it excels at, using traditional plot devices to spawn intriguing mysteries. Something it also does is making a lot of bold decisions when it comes to revealing mysteries. The first two episodes, especially the first; revealed many things that in any other media you wouldn't expect to be revealed until the middle to late stages. This is what I mean by it may be setting up something remarkable; perhaps it is paving way for even larger mysteries and getting the minor stuff out of the way. It is also incredible to see the High Republic era adapted to live television, and I think it nails the setting well. This is not my expertise within the Star Wars universe, so I would trust fans of this era prior over this comment. Overall I think this is a lot better than a lot of the recent content we've been getting from Star Wars, and certainly it is worth your time. Would do 7.5/10 if I could. This review also only considers only the current content available to us, the first two episodes, so 7/10 doesn't say a lot. The hype in the reviews from other enthusiasts are very real!",7.0

You don't know who characters are, what they are doing, where they are, and why the scene exists. What's the point?

The performances are wooden, lacking depth and emotion, making it difficult to become invested in the characters' journeys. The dialogue is cheesy and clunky, often feeling like a parody of sci-fi tropes rather than a genuine attempt at storytelling.Furthermore, the show's pacing is abysmal. The narrative meanders aimlessly, with long stretches of boring exposition and unnecessary tangents. The plot holes and logical fallacies are glaring, making it difficult to suspend disbelief. The characters are poorly developed, with too many quirks and traits that make them feel like caricatures rather than fully fleshed-out beings.The show's reliance on sci-fi jargon and aesthetics is also overwhelming, feeling like a shallow attempt to seem intelligent and complex. The action sequences, while occasionally impressive, are few and far between, leaving the viewer with long stretches of dull, uneventful storytelling.Perhaps most egregiously, The Acolyte fails to capture the spirit of Star Wars. The show lacks the heart, humor, and adventure that defines the franchise, feeling like a generic, low-budget sci-fi tale instead.In conclusion, The Acolyte is a galactic disappointment, failing to deliver on its promise of an engaging and exciting Star Wars experience.

The overt political messages feel forced and out of place, detracting from what should be a compelling story with well-developed characters. Fans are not looking for lectures; we crave the magic and adventure that Star Wars has always promised. George Lucas and Dave Filoni are sorely missed, as their visionary storytelling and deep respect for the lore are what the franchise desperately needs. Filoni, in particular, has proven time and again that he can craft narratives that resonate with fans old and new. It's frustrating to see such potential wasted on a series that fails to capture the essence of Star Wars.

Da-ta-da-ta-daaa. Everything seems mostly fine until of course the characters begin to intermingle and through no fault of their own (the cast's anyway) the dialogue is a lamentable mess.

" This is unwatchable
",2024-06-12,"I went into ""Acolytes"" with cautious optimism, hoping for a fresh and respectful addition to the Star Wars saga. Instead, what I witnessed was an utter travesty. Episode 3 of this new series has single-handedly demolished everything that makes Star Wars beloved by millions.Firstly, the plot is an incoherent mess that shows a blatant disregard for established lore. They've thrown all the iconic elements of Star Wars into the garbage, leaving behind a hollow shell. The storyline doesn't just fail to make sense-it actively undermines the entire saga.One of the most egregious offenses is the destruction of Anakin Skywalker's redemption arc. Anakin's journey from a Jedi to Darth Vader and back to the light was a central pillar of the original and prequel trilogies. ""Acolytes"" not only undermines this arc but obliterates it beyond recognition. The notion that Anakin's birth, once a unique and mysterious event conceived through the Force, is now rendered meaningless is a slap in the face to fans. By introducing other characters conceived in the same manner, the film diminishes Anakin's significance and cheapens his story.",1.0

I'm seriously considering canceling my subscription, as there are only bad films and series or ones I've seen before. Disney is terrible. How could George Lucas have sold such good material to be ruined, destroyed in this way by Disney? There is no way to believe that something good will be done for Star Wars. They ruined everything with this senseless militancy. We don't want to see ideology in films and series, we want to have fun, have a good story that encompasses what we had and not this rubbish that Disney tries to create. The only good things before the original films made by Lucas were the two seasons of The Mandalorian and ANDOR and ROGUE ONE. After that it just went downhill.

The plot feels disjointed and lacks the magic that once made Star Wars so special. The acting is horrendous, with performances that feel wooden and uninspired. It's almost as if the actors themselves don't believe in the material they are working with.The dialogues are stilted and awkward, making it hard to engage with the characters. The scriptwriters seem to have forgotten how to write natural, compelling conversations. On top of that, the actions taken by the characters are often illogical, leaving viewers scratching their heads and questioning their motivations.So there you go. You've destroyed it. The only positive aspect I can point out is that it looks good. The visual effects are impressive, and the production design is top-notch. However, good looks alone can't save a show from poor storytelling and weak performances.In the end, it is unwatchable.

Like everyone I was worried about Disney taking over. Unfortunately it is worse than I could have imagined. Other then the first season of Mandalorian and. Andor every new offering has gotten worse. Now this series is the coup de grace to the Star Wars series. I have to believe they made this so terrible that the series will end, there's really no other explanation. What is this?

Wanting to find out about the Sith shown in the trailer and what happened on a particular planet is a pretty good plot thread.The set and costume design is also pretty good, love the costumes for the Jedi and the sets on planets are also quite good, makes you feel involved.All in all, a pretty good start for the first 2 episodes, it feels a bit like a Young Adult novel but I mean in a good way; normally I'm not a big fan of those and I expected the show to be mid but it was a lot better than I thought.Worth the watch.",9.0

However, I understand that this can be a very subjective matter. The Acolyte is not Andor, which, at least for me, sets the standard by which I like to measure Star Wars series.Nevertheless, ""The Acolyte"" falls short of my expectations with its irregular pace and superficial character development. Despite the attempt to blend a crime story with classic Star Wars elements, the execution feels disjointed and lacks the necessary dark tone.What the series does achieve: It piques curiosity from episode to episode. As a true Star Wars fan, I can overlook the occasionally mediocre soundtrack that merely tries to imitate its predecessors.

It's like the writers don't even care about making characters that viewers can relate to or cheer for.The show doesn't even try to make the audience feel anything for the characters. The story doesn't bring out any emotions-no joy, no sadness, no excitement. It's just boring to watch. The acting doesn't help either; it's flat and unconvincing, which only makes it harder to get into the story.And the production quality? It's terrible too. It seems like everything was done by amateurs. The episodes feel like they were thrown together with bits of text written and recorded at different times, then patched together without any real thought. This lack of professionalism is super obvious and really hurts the show's potential.You have to wonder if the creators even realize that a show is supposed to entertain people.

" First 2 ok, third one terrible
",2024-06-13,"The first two episodes were ok, nothing special but didn't break lore. They were boring at some points, however I found the plot interesting at first.The dialog was pretty bad over first two episodes, with a lot of characters saying things they both already know just to tell the audience, which is very lazy. The fights were visually good and well choreographed, but they all seem to drag and be the same.The plot made little sense, and had a lot of plot holes. For example, the jedi accused her of committing murder when she had a good alibi for where she was, however she decided not to mention her twin until much later which also made no sense.The characters were all one dimensional and boring. They had decent motivations (until ep3 ruined it) but they all had no personality or defining traits.Episode 3 ruined the already very flawed show, and also broke star wars lore. Both Palpatine and plageuis took lots of time, research and work from 2 of the most powerful being in the galaxy to create anakin, yet these random witches can create the twins? Not buying it. They also started talking about threads, which made no sense when compared to how to force is. The force surrounds beings, and isnt a small thread. The singing was terrible and annoying, and the sister killing all the witches made no sense.

" Not good
",2024-06-06,"I think a 90s show could hold better than this. It just seems extremely bad. All the actors are terrible. The story line is very boring.Disney's focus on profit over storytelling has led to a decline in the quality of the films and shows. The sequel trilogy, starting with ""The Force Awakens,"" seemed more concerned with recycling familiar plot points and characters rather than taking risks and pushing the boundaries of the Star Wars universe. This lack of originality and creativity left fans feeling unsatisfied and betrayed.Additionally, Disney's decision to sideline the original characters, such as Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, in favor of new, less compelling characters further alienated fans. The mishandling of Luke Skywalker's character arc in ""The Last Jedi"" was particularly divisive and left many fans feeling betrayed by the direction the franchise was taking.Furthermore, Disney's relentless merchandising and commercialization of Star Wars has cheapened the brand. The constant flood of merchandise and tie-ins has made Star Wars feel more like a cash cow than a beloved saga. This blatant commercialization has undermined the integrity and authenticity of the franchise.Overall, Disney's mishandling of Star Wars has left fans feeling disillusioned and disheartened. The once-beloved saga has been reduced to a mere shadow of its former glory, and it is clear that Disney's focus on profit and commercialization has come at the expense of the storytelling and fan experience that made Star Wars so special.

" Critical Review of 'The Acolyte': A Star Wars Fan's Perspective
",2024-06-12,"As a lifelong Star Wars enthusiast, it deeply pains me to declare that 'The Acolyte' is one of the most lifeless and extremely boring shows I have ever encountered. To say it was disappointing would be an understatement. It has reached a point where I am seriously contemplating cancelling my Disney+ subscription.The script is abysmal, riddled with clichés and lacking any semblance of the magic that once defined the Star Wars universe. The dialogue is painfully dull, and the plot progression is excruciatingly slow. Episode 3, in particular, stands out as a nadir of the series, with its ridiculous storyline and poorly defined characters. The introduction of the witches of Dathomir is poorly executed and seemingly derivative, with clear elements stolen from the myth of The Norns spinning the threads of fate at the foot of Yggdrasil. Additionally, the concept of asexual reproduction for the twins is laughably absurd.The acting, too, leaves much to be desired. The performances are wooden and unconvincing, failing to evoke any emotional response. It is difficult to care about the characters or their fates when they are portrayed so dispassionately. I genuinely believe a two-year-old could deliver more compelling performances than what we are subjected to in 'The Acolyte'.Leslye Headland, the showrunner, has demonstrated an alarming lack of talent both as a director and a screenwriter. Her approach to this beloved franchise is nothing short of disastrous. It is clear that she lacks the creative vision and storytelling prowess needed to bring the Star Wars universe to life. The decision to entrust her with this project is baffling and has proven to be a monumental mistake.Reflecting on the bigger picture, two colossal errors have led us to this travesty: George Lucas selling his brand and leaving it in the hands of Kathleen Kennedy. Under their stewardship, the franchise has lost its way, with 'The Acolyte' being the most egregious example of this decline. The essence of Star Wars has been diluted, replaced by a soulless, uninspired cash grab.As a lifelong fan, it is disheartening to admit that I would rather watch 'Bridgerton'-a show that would never typically make it onto my watch list-than endure another episode of 'The Acolyte'. This sentiment speaks volumes about the show's profound failings.In conclusion, Leslye Headland, you suck. Your involvement in this project seems to be a testament to the power of connections over actual talent. Episode 3 is so badly written and ridiculous that it begs the question: is Disney intent on destroying itself, let alone allowing Kathleen Kennedy to dismantle a once-great brand? Just one word: Why? The Star Wars universe deserves better, and so do its fans. It is my fervent hope that future projects will restore the magic and wonder that once defined this beloved franchise.",

People did like Donny Yen's character.Director: hmm... yes... Sol.Writers: we need to represent both sides of the force to create some tension. What if we have twins? One good and one bad?Director: yes! Star Wars fans will be as shocked as when they found out Hans was Luke's father and cut his arm off. That's never been done before.Writers: we need an action prison break escape scene after the good twin was accused of what the bad twin did.Director: yes!

The performances are a major highlight, with Lee Jung-jae standing out as Jedi Master Sol-he's definitely my favorite.The visual effects and production values are impressive for a TV series.The fight scenes are truly great, adding excitement and energy to the show.The world-building is intriguing, setting the story in a different era without the familiar Skywalkers and others...The pacing is well-executed, and the tone strikes a nice balance, avoiding excessive goofiness.Plus, you don't need prior knowledge of the Star Wars universe to enjoy this series, making it accessible to newcomers.There are some mixed aspects, though:
The episodes are relatively short-just when you're getting into it, the credits roll.The young cast is talented, but a bit more variety could add depth, although this is subjective.Some elements are reminiscent of CW shows, which may or may not be your cup of tea.The writing is competent but tends to play it safe, making it somewhat predictable.Also, Dafne Keen is much cuter without the alien makeup, just my opinion...Overall, if Andor is Star Wars for adults, The Acolyte is Star Wars for young adults.It's a good show that expands the Star Wars universe in a fresh direction.While it may not be compelling enough to justify a Disney+ subscription on its own, it's definitely worth checking out.Just don't expect it to be your new obsession.",7.0

" Uninspired and lacking energy.
",2024-06-05,"Star Wars under Disney has been a bumpy road. Sometimes great, sometimes only ok, too often a disappointment. The two first episodes of The Acolyte point in the direction of yet another disappointment.Only two episodes in, it is too early to say much about the overall story. Maybe it will work and tie in with the existing lore, maybe not. As we have seen with the Kenobi show, to use one of the worst examples, sometimes Disney totally fail in making the story tie in with what we have already seen (A New Hope is clearly the first time Leia and Kenobi ever meet, and clearly the first time Vader and Kenobi meet since their fight in Revenge of the Sith). The story in The Acolyte takes place 100 years before the events in Phantom Menace and is supposed to be about the Sith if I am not mistaken. Let's see where that goes.These two episodes are very uninspired and lack any sort of energy. First off, the acting is just not good. It is almost like the actors are rehearsing the scenes only, saving all their energy for a shot that never happened, or was left on the cutting room floor. They are going through their motions and their dialog without any conviction or energy, it is mostly flat and dull. Granted, not every actor in the history of Star Wars have been great, but this time around it is bad all over. Which makes me think the problem is probably not the actors themselves, but rather the director. But what do I know.My second gripe is with the pacing of the episodes, sometimes it jumps back and forth between scenes without any purpose. I do like that they use some of the old ""swipes"" we know from the original movies though, a plus for that.My third gripe is with the design of some of the characters. There are (so far) three characters that visually look like nothing more than regular humans on their way to a costume-party, rather than like characters in a Star Wars story. On one hand it is great that they mix new character designs with familiar ones (and as much as I liked Andor, there was a major lack of aliens and droids compared to human characters in that show), but these three only look like robed humans with a rubber nose (or ears or horns) and a lot of makeup on their faces. Nothing more. Total lack of imagination and effort from the design department.Finally, I think the CGI looks far too much like something made with AI. Not always, but in some scenes.I will probably watch a few of the coming episodes, to give it a fair shot, but this might very well be the first live-action Star Wars I will give up on. Dull, uninspired, and lacking any sort of energy and conviction.",2.0

At first I though I missed something so I came here to see the reviews others wrote, and apparently I am not the only one. To sum up my biggest disappointment comes from the bad writing, and teenager I read some Star Wars book that were very good. They don't even have to do something new, just fire the writers, take the best Star Wars book, change it a bit and put it in the show. And VOILA, it will improve greatly.

" Started off 'okay,' then episode 3 demolished all hope.
",2024-06-12,"As a huge fan of anything Star Wars, I can honestly say that this series lacks any imagination. The first 2 episodes were decent enough to make me continue to watch.... But the 3rd episode was simply just RIDICULOUS. They've turned the series into a FAN FILM!?!? This belongs on YouTube.If I was rating the series based only on the cast, the sets, & special effects, I would give it a 10/10.The writing alone, drops the rating of this series to a 3/10.They've managed to reduce the series into what appears to be a bunch of cosplayers, quickly reading a high school level script, performing it immediately after reading, while one of the cosplayers recorded it and released the footage to the public.I will continue to watch the series because I am a Star Wars completist, but my hopes for the show to redeem itself, is extremely low at this time of this review.",3.0
" Who was this made for? It certainly wasn't Star Wars fans.
",2024-06-05,"I've just finished the first two episodes of The Acolyte and I feel compelled to write this review. For brevity's sake, here's my two word review:It's terrible.It's poorly acted, written and cast. I can't remember any of the characters names and I've literally just watched it. My favourite character was a robot toolbox. It's the only character that had any character and it's a prop - that's never good.Carrie Anne Moss features heavily in the marketing and is killed off before the title credits (possibly will appear in flashback or some other capacity).I keep asking myself ""who are they making this for?""
It doesn't feel like they're making it for people who like Star Wars but that has been the case for some time now.It was two episodes of nothing happening. We are given hints of a larger plot but I don't care about the players in this larger plot because I'm given nothing to care for.Go watch Empire Strikes Back instead - it's a better use of your time.",2.0

And unlike Most who wrote horrible fan fictions when they're in middle school and have them end up stashed away in some drawer, this child had a daddy with a lot of money and decided to turn it into an actual show.For a show that is naming itself a thriller, there is not much to feel thrill towards. Everything is just told to you. No need to put the pieces together or try to solve it yourselves. Everything is solved for you.This leads to my main issue: the writing. Character dialogue is unnatural, and everyone talks like imbeciles. There is little to no suspense: Star Wars was truly placed in the wrong hands here.In an attempt to make a mature Star Wars show, Leslie Hedland has made a comedy, and unfortunately, one that isn't very funny.",2.0
" Not very good
",2024-06-16,Not understanding the direction of this show or series. It's so different than what I grew up with. Doesn't feel like a Star Wars film at all. It was really sad to see that the Jedi seemed to be the bad guys. The Jedi were meant to save the universe. I've recently started to watch all of the stars wars films again and most of the stars films are really good. It's such a great complex story about good and evil and who the good guys are. This film confused me and half the time I don't know how is good or evil. I wish we didn't have to change everything. It's not a good addition to the Star Wars brand.,1.0

I made myself watch the first two episodes, as no MLB was on HULU, heck I'd of taken WNBA at this point, and I literally didn't care what happened to a single character. Jedi are now Ninjas with Lightsabers. Because why wouldn't they now have abilities they've never had before. It's just horrid.

Negative reviews get more views than positives ones. It's not actually an honest review. They're all just trying to get more views and they'll say anything bad to get it.I saw a bunch of bad reviews on youtube and after watching the show it's about two sisters. Yin and yang, good vs evil. Standard star wars stuff. Family and siblings fighting on opposite sides. The fighting was cool and the story is just starting to develop. I don't see how you can just write this off as a disaster from two episodes.They didn't make any star wars content for over a decade and If these people keep blindly review bombing every new film or show. They'll stop making them and then we won't get anymore. I don't know about you but i enjoy them all. They're all good in their own way.The show is a 7/10 so far and will only get better as the story develops. If you're rating the show a one. You're clearly biased against Disney/Star Wars.",

Sure, there is some clunky writing but overall it's really good. I like the fact that they show younger Jedi with different maturity levels. The point of many Star Wars stories is that the Jedi are not perfect. Many of the negative reviews just reflect a general hatred of Disney and are not objective.

One character will have a staunch position on something, state they refuse to change their mind then 6 seconds with another character they totally flip.And then there's episode 3... well less said about that the better really. I'm just tired of this low brow, low effort nonsense by people with no actually passion and/or understanding of the IP they're butchering. What happened to all the good writers? I honestly thought that Robyn Hood show was the worst thing I'd ever watched but wow this has or is really close to trumping that.In essence: if you like any of the Star Wars movies give this a hard pass.

Acolyte makes the Jedi look like complete and utter wimps who lack the skills, brainpower and force ability to take on rudimentary missions.

Because those who were hired are famous for such hits as Russian Doll. Directing episodes of S. W. A. T and other procedural shows. Not a single director who has done anything close to this scale. Nobody with a vision.People love Andor because Disney hired someone who's made huge films in this genre for decades and he had a vision. And it shows. Or when they hired Jon Favreau to do the Mandalorian. This show feels like it was made by people who never liked Star Wars. Just like Kenobi, just like Boba Fett.All Disney has to do is call up any director who knows what they're doing and ask if they have an idea.

Now though I said it's still too early to critique the whole thing, it's proving a bit of an iffy entry into Star Wars' lofty canon in film and television.The Acolyte does do some stuff right like nailing the vibe of Star Wars, but the writing seems a tad shallow and the actors are making the best of the material they're stuck with. Maybe with all the whining people are making about this show now the other stuff on Disney+ isn't so... bad?Honestly: the premature backlash just doesn't seem right UNTIL the entire thing's been released. I said this about Obi-Wan Kenobi and I'll stick with this argument for every other time this becomes an issue. Review-bombing just seems like an immature way to adversely affect products people deem as 'woke' or 'bad' so early on. The Acolyte is competent television, but it ain't the golden age 'event television' The Mandalorian proved itself to be. Heck, Acolyte ain't on the same level as The Bad Batch. Hopefully Skeleton Crew will be an improvement.P. S. It's certainly pissed off some people for the right reasons, but some of the 'feedback' seems to be coming from Prequel apologists thinking the word owes George Lucas an 'overdue apology'. To each their own. But this show needs to have a breakout episode sooner rather than later.",

" A Disappointment in a Galaxy Far, Far Away
",2024-06-05,"As a long-time Star Wars fan, I had high hopes for ""The Acolyte."" Unfortunately, this series has been a massive letdown, primarily due to its atrocious writing.From the start, the plot feels disjointed and lacks the coherent storytelling that Star Wars is known for. Characters are introduced with little to no background, making it hard to care about their journeys. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and often feels forced, devoid of the natural flow and wit we've come to expect from the franchise.The pacing is another major issue. The series drags in places where it should be exciting and rushes through moments that could have been impactful. Instead of creating a captivating narrative, it feels like the writers were more interested in ticking boxes than telling a compelling story.Moreover, the show's attempts at expanding the lore fall flat. Rather than enriching the Star Wars universe, ""The Acolyte"" adds unnecessary complications and contradicts established canon in frustrating ways. This not only confuses long-time fans but also dilutes the essence of what makes Star Wars so special.In short, ""The Acolyte"" is a prime example of wasted potential. Its terrible writing undermines what could have been an intriguing addition to the Star Wars saga. If you're a fan looking for the magic of the original trilogy or the depth of The Mandalorian, you'll be sorely disappointed.",1.0

There are no attempts made to have the audience guess, no, its verbatim told again, and again ... There is no ""there is another"" (OJ Star Wars), no, they go so fast from 0 to 100, that your head can not turn in time.We have master Jedi losing fights in ways that can only be described as ""wtf"" (like they nerfed Jedi Int and abilities down to 2/10). Characters that seem to know about Jedi secrets and how to exploit them, where you again need to go ""wtf, that makes no sense"".The acting feels bland and more what your expect from cosplay actors (and to be honest, i have seen WAY better cosplay then this series delivers) in its two episodes.The interaction between actors feels awkward, like strangers talking to each other, when they are portrayed as friends of good collogues.There are issues with sense of time, like they tried to rush so much in a few episodes, that there is a issue in several scenes with the flow of time.Confrontations that make no sense if you look at the flow of time and how people travel. Even more so is some of the witnesses of a crime, yet, no thought was placed into a counter of innocence (trust me, think about that scene for a few seconds, the location, ... how is X guilty and yet, the location and time) yet, the Jedi intelligence is again 2/10 ...It feels like a bad Disney theme park and to be honest, i have seen way better acting from those parks.Do not see how this can even be considered this 10/10 with a scalding ""you are not a real SW fan"" for not giving it a 10/10. Has our standards dropped so much? Or are we looking at paid bot accounts because something feels off. Are people that desperate for any SW content, that they ignore the low standards being shown.Yes, its not Andor, but compared to Ahsoka.(a heavily flawed serie), it makes Ahsoka look like a masterpiece...

" Very Disappointed
",2024-06-16,"I tried to like it. I really did.I've watched every single bit of Star Wars and for the most part loved it. Its such a rich and expansive universe with great characters, themes and stories. The sequel trilogy knocked my enthusiasm a bit but then the Mandalorian and its spin offs, Andor and the live action characters from Rebels appearing in Ahsoka brought me right back in.This...it may be the first Star Wars that I don't see through to the end and I hate that I don't feel I can put myself through any more of it after watching three episodes.It was billed as a bit of a mystery show running up to its release. There is no mystery here. The mystery elements seem to last all of five minutes before being revealed. There is no buildup to anything then the reveals are pretty predictable. They made it look like there could be something very interesting going on with our lead character, being arrested for a crime only to reveal in no time at all that oh, she has an evil twin.There are some really good actors in the show, Carrie Anne Moss, Dafne Keen, among others. Unfortunately the characters they are playing are not particularly developed at all, with the pace and direction of things not allowing any and their acting comes across as very wooden, less because of their performance skills but because the dialogue is terribly written.The first two episodes seem to have basically revealed the entire plotline. Then there is episode three... this is where it completely lost me. We find out the twins are immaculate force conceptions, created by a coven of lesbian force witches (The showrunner said this) and we get to see the events in their origin that were referenced in the prior two episodes. Its clear that the evil twin seems to have been born a raging sociopath with no complex motivations at all that made her this way and despite being raised in an isolated commune the ""good"" twin has an ambition to leave everything to become a jedi? Again with no explanation as to why. Evil twin decides to burn the entire place to the ground to kill her sister for wanting to leave and all the witches just die offscreen. Its terrible storytelling. I can only assume this is Leslye Headland's teenage fanfiction with a multi million dollar budget.I approached the show with hope it would be as good as The Mandalorian or Andor while exploring an era of star wars that hasn't been seen before.

No offence to any precocious child out there, but the show will entertain almost all children that like this genre and they won't find a reason to complain about any of the above lol.If you want a comparison from the same universe: Andor is made for discerning adults, and this show is made for children.",1.0
" A mess
",2024-06-12,"As a long-time Star Wars fan, it pains me to say that the franchise seems to have lost its way. The latest spin-off, while boasting a cool concept, failed to capture the magic and excitement that once defined Star Wars. It's reminiscent of the disappointment I felt with the third season of The Mandalorian - promising at first glance, but ultimately underwhelming.The franchise, once a beacon of innovative storytelling and unforgettable characters, now feels mediocre. It's disheartening to see such a beloved series lose its luster. Perhaps it's time for me to explore new galaxies, far away from Star Wars.I found it hard to force myself to like it. The legacy of Star Wars deserves better than this. It's time for Disney to course correct and breathe new life into this once-thriving universe. .",1.0
" Disappointing Addition to Star Wars
",2024-06-05,"This was an overwhelming disappointing since my family loved the Mandalorian and Andor series and we were expecting something creative and engaging. Sadly, the dialog was predictable and tended to be boring to slog through. The set designs weren't very original with the typical remote outpost motif with a bit more color. No interesting vehicles or dress - just copied from previous Star Wars series with a few modifications. Boring.I thought Amandla Stenberg did a credible job as Osha delivering the boring lines with a boring storyline well. However, her performance couldn't save this lackluster series start. Let's hope it picks up in episode 3.",2.0
" Star Wars Franchise has hit a new LOW
",2024-06-20,"Lifelong Star Wars fan here. This series has MANY issues. I have compiled a list of problems that stand out the most in my eyes. A rocky start with the debut of episodes 1-2 that leave you thinking this may have promise, but giving red flag after red flag. After the release of episodes 3 and 4, our worst fears have been realized.1; Too short of run times for episodes! How do you expect to tell a compelling story when your latest episode is 27 minutes long!2; Poor basic narrative storytelling.3; Atrocious dialogue and direction.4; Breaking their own canon. Bringing in a prequel character that is only supposed to be 70 years old.5; Does not follow basic fundamentals of logic for their own world.It just feels like one thing after another. We are half way through this series and I pray that somehow things turn around. As stated before, I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan. I can recognize this franchise has had problems in the past with films and their series both. As a consumer, Star Wars is not firing on all cylinders. With a budget of $180 million on this project, I'm looking around and asking where it went? Yes, the sets look great for the most part! Learn from this Disney. Shoot ON LOCATION. Use the volume sparingly. I'm not sure if all of this falls on the showrunner, or it should fall more on Kathleen Kennedy. Greatest producer, does not equal good CEO. It's time for a change.",3.0
" Really Bad
",2024-06-24,"It's as bad as everyone says it is. Horribly written. So much bad exposition and horribly pacing. Large chunks of the show are just plain boring with bad writing throughout and they are constantly repeating plot points by both telling us what happens with exposition and then showing us with flashbacks. Why do we need whole episodes of flashback? This is a new show, they should have started where it began instead of having long breaks from the narrative to give us context via boring flashbacks. One whole episode is a flashback, but they told us almost everything that episode shows before that episode through exposition. So, why the flashback episode? Why the exposition? We didn't need both, we just needed one. This show is bad (watched to episode 4) from the start to where I gave up. Don't give disney views on this show, it will just encourage more of the same poor quality stuff disney is known for these days.

" Updated review after episode 3
",2024-06-06,"Edit: after watching episode 3, it seems a lot better done, I changed my review from a 3 to a 7 so far. The reason why this episode changed so much for me is that it added much needed context that instantly made the story more interesting and I felt more invested. Starwars does its best when factions have grey areas, and the grey areas are a lot more fleshed out now, and its one of those stories where you can emphasize with the ""dark side"" more than usual. The first two episodes were still REALLY rough, and I'll stand by that, but this third episode is one even huge critics of the first two will want to see. I felt like there was some details that were left a little unexplained, but its possible the reason why is so they can reveal them later. (How did *everyone* in the fortress die from that fire?)I'll preface this by saying I love starwars, and consume almost all the media out there, I actually like a lot of disney starwars. This show is a rare exception. (ultra vague spoilers ahead). I'll start with the good, the acting was good ad I had zero complaints there, the actors are phenomenal, and the set design feels like starwars, even if some of the action sequences do not. The writing is bad, many things are said instead of shown, and it ends up being so cheesy. Also characters with shared history don't recall the past and mention every detail for the sake of the audience. Much of the ""humor"" is just really off, kind of like the ""your mom"" joke in the last jedi. I don't know what their budget was, but it seems low production value. Fights don't feel like fights, they feel like hyper choreographed dances, they reminded me of martial arts films like ""crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" or ""hero"", and not a true struggle for life and death, or other starwars fight sequencs you'd come to expect. A couple of the jedi so far don't really act like jedi at all, one jedi just kills himself because he was asked nicely (theres some deeper story to it, but its really sudden and not like a jedi to just off themselves for something in their past), another jedi is easy to anger. One of the series unique choices is costume design, and while its in ""the high republic"" era, 100 years before the rise of the empire, and I can imagine there would be some cultural differences over 100 years, the designs seem unusually ornate for jedi. The alien design seems low quality, there is a character that is the same race as Bariss Offee from the clone wars tv show, and it really just looks like a human with face paint. Another alien looks like they had a bunch of stiff prosthetics hastily glued to their face. And I swear a beard was glued on to some character, you'll know who I'm referring to in the 2nd episode. I don't want to seem hateful, but I almost think I could've done a better job writing it just because I'm a more discerning media viewer that notices the little things and has more in my toolbox to convey a story other than just having characters say it. It feels like something you'd see from an amateur or someones first few screenplays or drama projects. Its supposed to be a mystery genre, but I feel like the mystery is already dissolved and they are just chasing who they know did the murders from episode 2 forwards. The only reason I may finish this show is because I'm a starwars mega nerd, but I'm not exactly looking forward to it. This show makes Kenobi and Book of Boba Fett look fantastic in comparison, but I will concede that its only the two episode premier so far. Maybe I'm just spoiled by how good Andor and the Mandalorian were. I don't think Disney should branch out and make too many shows if they are going to be low quality like this. The thoughts I was left with were ""was nepotism involved in this production""",7.0
" This show is not for children or long-time Star Wars fans...so who's it for?
",2024-06-06,"Star Wars has for decades followed established cinematography techniques and shot-aesthetics that help imerse the viewer in another galaxy. This show does not.Problems include:
-Episodes appear to have borrowed sets from the straight-to-youtube game show series, Star Wars: Jedi Temple Challenge.-Sets feel enclosed with minimal wide shots to establish where characters are.-The editing is rushed, with screenwipes overused and inconsistent with their use in the original trilogy.-Further overuse of handheld shaky-cam (This began with the Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi limited series.)
-The show constantly appears overlit by a single-point light source with very little atmosphere. (As if someone is just holding a giant lightbulb just out of frame...)
-Overuse of subtitles to establish locations. (Anyone watching Star Wars knows Coruscant by now...Let the story establish the location...)
-Ships and droids are generic and unimaginative, looking ripped straight from series such as Red Dwarf rather than following established Star Wars design aesthetics. (Nobody is going to want to buy toys of these characters!)
-Background actors/extras constantly over-acting to the point of drawing more attention to themselves than the main in-focus characters.-Inconsistent alien make-up/prosthetics. While there are quite a few impressive new alien designs in the opening scenes, skip ahead and the most prominant aliens have been relegated to wearing nothing but ill-fitting bucket-like costumes.-Inconsistent tone of dialogue. (Certain scenes feel like you are watching a CW dramedy...)Why?:
-A shirtless male Jedi steam-irons his clothes (Yes, you read that correctly! Are Disney now already paroding themselves? Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi introduced that infamously bad ironing scene...)-A male Jedi gets distracted by an attractive female Jedi, stops looking through his macrobinoculars and loses his target during a murder investigation. (Are all male Jedi except Sol incompetent 100 years before The Phantom Menace)-A man under the influence of narcotics quotes a line from the Sith Code as if it's a common phrase, which should not be common knowledge by anyone except the two current Sith Lords. (Always two there are. No more. No less!)This show is not for children:
-A Jedi commits suicide by drinking poison. (Honestly, this episode should have come with a self-harm warning...)Goofs:
-Padwans told to close their eyes. Unfortunately, somebody forgot to give one poor alien the ability to close their eyes.Positives:
-Lee Jung-jae's character, Sol, is quite likeable and his acting is a stand-out amongst the very bland delivery by the other actors in the series. He should be given the chance to return to this role in future Star Wars shows set in this era.-They seem to have gotten Neimoidians right.",2.0

The Jedi costumes are bad, the dialogue is bad and the plot boring. Let's not even get started on their poor use of Carrie Ann Moss.

The older generations expect things to improve over time. The younger generations seem perfectly happy will terrible storytelling and writing. Perhaps because of the way we enjoy media now.

The fact that just after 2 episodes setting up the story that the show has bombed in ratings is extremely dissapointing.

I made it through episode 1 and 2 I couldn't make it through episode 3 .So much cringe !!!! Terrible acting , the show itself looks cheap especially with that huge budget. The writing is terrible you can already tell what's going to happen and who the villain is .. Sol isn't a terrible character but that's about it ! Fans can only hope we get another season of Ashoka or even Kenobi ! Something to help us forget this steaming pile of garbage was ever given to star wars fans !!! We deserve better.",1.0
" DO THEY EVEN KNOW STAR WARS????
",2024-06-06,"Bad directing, bad writing, bad editing and bad acting. This continues to be a pattern with the majority of Star Wars products by Disney. They obviously have the money based on the production value, but they keep getting the same thing wrong.Who is the audience they are trying to reach? This feels more like a made for tv young adult novel than a Star Wars show. The actors have perfect hair with perfect costumes. The sets are too colorful and perfect to the point of being unrealistic. It just doesn't feel like Star Wars.This series has time to turn things around, but I don't think it can. Can the writing, acting and directing all improve over the course of this series? Maybe, but I doubt it's enough to make that much difference. Yet another unnecessary waste that diminishes the Star Wars brand.",3.0
" Yes, this is Disney.
",2024-06-05,"I can't escape the framework of a teenage drama.I can no longer expect to rely on Disney's identity. Even as time passes, one can only admire the focus on movies that are easy to watch before going to bed, rather than Disney's consistent family, teenage, and fairytale-like storytelling.It is time to decide whether we need to wait and watch Disney movies in the future. It will be sufficient to focus solely on distribution for a while without getting involved in movie production. This is because there seems to be some money left. I see not getting involved in incision making as Disney's final good deed to avoid damaging the movie entertainment business. Please stay and don't try this at Disney.",6.0
" The Worst Thing That Happened To Star Wars
",2024-06-10,"This show must have been written by the absolute worst writers of all time, I cannot believe someone greenlit this project, and I cannot believe someone let Leslye Headland, the former personal assistant of convicted sex criminal Harvey Weinstein, oversee and produce a Star Wars series. The amount of absolute horrible business decisions that must've been taken in order to produce this absolute piece of garbage is astounding. If you think this is anything even remotely close to what Star Wars is all about then you are so severely lost. I must believe most of the people who praise this show are lying to everyone including themselves, otherwise we are lost as a species. This is the worst attempt at entertainment of all time. I would rather watch paint dry than The Acolyte. Delete this.",1.0
" The show that ruined Star Wars for me
",2024-06-11,"I never thought I would see the day where I do not get excited for each week that a new Star Wars episode was released but thanks to the Acolyte, Star Wars is now dead to me. The acting and story is terrible and you can tell whoever created this show does not even care about the Star Wars source material. The thing that make Star Wars so brilliant and enjoyable are the characters you come to love and for this show there has been no character development what so ever. For how much money they spent on marketing and the production, the costumes and makeup are shotty at best. I really hope a lesson is learned from this show going forward that if you have someone who hates the IP produce a show in that IP it will never be successful.",1.0
" Horrible
",2024-06-11,"Couldnt even get through the first episode, they are ruining the star wars franchise. I really hope this changes soon or disney is gonna fall. They really need to fire everyone! Please stop doing this to these shows and movies and not just the stars wars franchise, the marvel execs need to see whats happening and change their direction because they are going down the same direction. Disney execs need to wake up, listen to the majority and stop listening to the small portion of people that want to change peoples minds on certain things. We want entertainment not social causes in our movies. Stop it already!",1.0
" Terrible in every respect...
",2024-06-05,"This is the absolute worst Star Wars content ever made. The horrific acting, dialog, and story are too poorly done to put into words. I am baffled beyond belief how this top shelf piece of garbage got the green light. Everything is complete cringe, and I cannot recommend this complete waste of time, effort, and money to anyone. Any long-time Star Wars fan will find this drivel to be utterly insulting to the franchise. Meanwhile, those not familiar with the lore will be incredibly confused and confounded by what they are seeing. There are literally zero redeeming qualities to this pile of cinematic manure.",1.0
" Wooden and disjointed
",2024-06-06,Where to start. The story hasn't been fleshed out properly and you just have to presume/assume certain things as the show moves along. Fight scenes are a bit wooden and predictable. We appear to be going over old ground (again) with a slight twist. I'm surprised that Carrie Ann Moss and Lee Jung-jae are in this. They both have started in much better movies/TV series. I'm sure the 'new' Star Wars fans will find it good/entertaining. I wanted to like it but it makes Ahsoka look good and that was stiff and slightly lifeless at times. Fingers crossed they don't messed up series 2 of Andor. It might be time to give Star Wars a miss from now on.,3.0
" Worst show maybe ever
",2024-06-23,As a longtime Star Wars fan even knowing the creator made it with propaganda in mind for young children I still had to give it a shot. Doesn't even feel like star wars at all. Characters are boring and almost seem put together by a child. Writing might be the worst I have ever seen. I feel bad for some of the actors as they are not bad. But a few of them have no business being in a show or movie or even a tik tok they are outright terrible. I couldn't make it past episode 2 show was so terrible I could not continue. Do yourself a favor and skip this one all together. Especially if you are a star wars fan. I think I have lost all hope in the franchise after this installment.,1.0
" without coherence
",2024-06-16,"The story lacks coherence with the entire original plot of ""Star Wars"", throwing away the plots of other series or films. They also destroy a base argument in the entire saga ""force"" by changing its name and its meaning in the saga, since throughout the saga it is explained to us that force is an essence that surrounds everyone and that no one has total control over it. And that in this series they use it completely and absolutely has no coherence and detracts from the events of Episode I. In the end it is a series without coherence to what the saga is and disrupts the previous works or leaving them without merit.",1.0
" Painfully awful
",2024-06-07,Sorry but a little preteen looking girl just doesn't make for a good Star Wars antagonist. Shes not the least bit intimidating no matter how powerful you try to make her I just can't take her character seriously. The script seems like it was written for a school play not a big budget Star Wars show. Bad writing and even worse casting. Try your hardest to give this a chance and take interest in the characters and you just can't do it it's impossible. They tried to add this Matrix/Crouching tiger feel to Star Wars and it comes off even dumber than it sounds. I thought people were being to hard on this show and it was just a lot of overly critical Star Wars fans but then I watched it and I realized everyones hatred of this show is completely well founded. I'll give it 2 stars because the effects are kinda cool I guess but I'm really reaching to find something good to say about this.,1.0
" First two episodes
",2024-06-06,"Aside critic bombs first two episodes better than I expected. It wasn't bad at all. There are a few distinct charecters, story is fine, and not complicated, dialogs are fine. But of course we need to see next episodes for better judgement of the entire show.Yes there are a few problems. Like some lame scenes, a few logical mistakes or the question in the space ""where were you last night""?. But those are not a critical problems can solve by next episodes.What I have seen first two episodes is a decent starwars TV show. But Disney put the Leslie headland in a annoying position, Leslie also help them make it worse about his personal demonstration.Hope Acolyte can have a good story and worth to watch.",7.0
" Don't waste your time with this one.
",2024-06-07,"The Acolyte emerges as a series that struggles to find its footing in the expansive Star Wars universe. The series' writing falls short of expectations, with dialogue and narrative complexity that seems to be written at a 4th to 6th-grade level, lacking the sophistication one might anticipate from a franchise steeped in rich lore and history.Character development takes a backseat as the show prioritizes Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion themes. Causing the series to feel unbalanced, and overshadowing the potential for character growth and engagement.The storyline itself is a convoluted web that leaves viewers puzzled rather than intrigued. Plot points appear disjointed, making it challenging to follow a coherent narrative thread. The acting, unfortunately, does not redeem these narrative flaws; performances come across as forced, failing to resonate with the audience or breathe life into the characters.Perhaps the most disheartening aspect for fans is the show's departure from the quintessential Star Wars feel. Instead of the familiar galaxy far, far away, The Acolyte presents a universe that feels alien to the saga's spirit. It resembles a cheap imitation, a shadow of the franchise's former glory, seemingly designed to capitalize on the brand name rather than to contribute meaningfully to its legacy.The Acolyte is a series that had the potential to explore new horizons but ultimately feels like an incredibly missed opportunity.Don't waste your time with this one.",1.0
" Ruined my life
",2024-06-22,"I just smashed my TV in front of 30 guests at my Acolyte viewing party because of how terrible the show was. My wife just took our crying kids and said they're all spending the week at a hotel. This show has ruined my life and my party. I will now suffer from crippling loneliness for the rest of my adult life forever remembering that the Acolyte is sorely responsible for this. I expect an apology from Disney and a check to cover the cost of the therapy I will need to recover from today. I can't handle this anymore. Goodbye Star Wars. I am no longer a fan in fact, an enemy you will see me in court one day. Thank you and goodbye.",1.0
" I give up...
",2024-06-13,"Ok... I give up on Star Wars finally... like a crackhead I've been jonesing for more good stuff so I've been watching the last few shows and hoping the situation would turn around but... This ain't it. Last episode a book on fire set fire to a huge fortress of... STONE. Yeah... you heard right STONE on fire. When added to the episode where a fire starts in OUTER SPACE it's just too insulting to keep watching (not to mention very boring). Also the female characters are written and acted and directed so god awful it makes me miss the Ellen Ripley's, Sarah Connor's, Trinity, etc. At 200 million dollars... it's ridiculous how bad this is, Godzilla Minus One was made for about 12 million and is amazing... so I know that good writing, acting, and directing sill happen... just apparently not at Disney. The best I'm hoping for is they get desperate and sell the rights back to Lucas because he definitely knows fire can't happen in the vacuum of space, among other things. Sad but true, get ready to cringe...",1.0
" Disney hates its fans and seeks to destroy Star Wars
",2024-06-13,"I honestly didn't think it could get any worse than it already was, but Disney never ceases to amaze me in how they can buy franchises and destroy them faster than Microsoft can. Don't watch it. Everyone hates it. The writing is terrible. The ""detective work"" is something that wouldn't even hold water in a hardy boys book. Please don't watch it. You will wish you had that hour of your life back. The main character is not an enjoyable character. Did they even test this with audiences before release? The trailer has around 20,000 likes and almost 300,000 dislikes and yet they are touting it as a huge success. It is garbage. Disney hates it's audience. Don't waste your time.",1.0
" Missed the mark
",2024-06-06,"I came in. This was a clear conscious. I didn't watch any reviews or any spoilers from the get-go. These new actors playing Jedi Knights just miss the mark on so many levels. The acting is bad. Carrie Moss killed it though and now she is dead. Her emotional fight scene was next level. Once I realized it was bad I went on internet... I found a video of the Jefi Knight, not sure his name. Stating that Anakin blew up the Death Star? He clearly is not a fan and it shows in his acting ability. Kk and LH are destroying the Lucas Legacy. I applaud George for wanting to pass the torch, but these clowns put out the fire. I hope George takes back the reigns and delivers true Star Wars content.",1.0
" Unwatchable
",2024-06-10,"Please someone take Star Wars, the best franchise in the history of cinema, away from Disney.This series has fully departed from the original spirit of Star Wars. They managed to produce an extremely dull series, with no charismatic heroes, no surprises, no tension, and most importantly, no magic. It is really the best thing unfair to the fans of Star Wats all over the world.It is impossible to care about the characters, there is no background, just a bunch of people interacting. The plot is not even worthy of a second class video game. Just forced scenarios, with no aim, no purpose and extremely poor acting.Also, not even children can enjoy watching this. My kids have lost their interest in Star Wars. Star Wars has always been an amazing experience to share with kids, but the new format of telenovela has no appeal to children.You don't necessary need famous and expensive actors to make Star Wars work. You need a good story and a casting that looks for talented, charismatic actors. The cast would be great for a FIFA or UN advertising.Star Wars has a standard. It's movies were all brilliant. Some better, some worse. But there was a very high standard. Star Wars should not be used as a sausage factory.I am a big fan of Star Wars and it really hurts to see what Disney has done with it.",1.0
" An ignominious end to the Star Wars franchise
",2024-06-16,"The quality of the Star Wars films has been declining in recent years, but this film sets new lows. Rather than creating a film that conveys an interesting and entertaining storyline in this fantasy universe, the creators appear to have focused on a political message. There are films with strong female leads that manage not to alienate the fan base - for example, the recent Fallout series - but with The Acolyte it's almost as if the intent was to stick a finger in the eye of every existing Star Wars fan. Truly, the worst thing that ever happened to Star Wars was it's acquisition by Disney. This film is so bad, it has me thinking my default answer on anything Disney will henceforth be ""no"".",1.0
" It's Depressing!!!
",2024-06-22,"There was nothing about it that was enjoyable! This show has so little to do with the actual star wars series that they should have just made it their own show instead of continuing to tarnish what we all knew and loved from LucasFilm! I'm begging you please do not watch this sad excuse for a Star Wars film series! I got more entertainment from reading all of the poor reviews that people left. It's fairly evident that the writers, actors and producers did not take into account any of the fans during the making of this series. This is entirely about what they wanted it to be! We need George Lucas and Dave Filoni back!!!",1.0
" IGNORE THE LOW REVIEWS
",2024-06-26,"I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan(atic). But I do enjoy Sci-fi and space dramas. Star Wars has ALWAYS been too PG for me to be honest, so The Acolyte is on par for what most of the franchises series has produced. Some of the series are better than others. But, by no means does this series deserve the amount of hate from the haters.Again, you get the standard ""Jedi"" contingent and the usual ""Darkside"" bad guys or the ""on the wrong path"", storyline. You got your muppets & droids etc. What more were you expecting? Seriously, I want to know. Yes, it's geared for a slightly younger audience but I feel it's worth watching if you need your Sci-fi fix.I've watched the first 4 episodes and gave it a 6of10. Ignore the hate and watch it. People who are giving the 1of10 ratings are sheeple.",6.0
" Terrible
",2024-06-23,"How could it have come to this? A truly awful production. Nothing to love in this series. Stay away. If you have any love for the Star Wars universe, you would do well to avoid this series. The writing is shallow, the characters lack the depth of previous storylines. I wanted to give up after the first episode, but managed to survive until the third. No more. I felt that the previous series under the Disney umbrella were pretty good, and remained mostly within a range. That has ended abruptly with the Acolyte. It's hard to imagine how this show will be allowed to continue subjecting us to this type of storytelling.",1.0
" Just wasn't a good product overall
",2024-06-07,"I'm writing this for the betterment of the franchise. I've been watching Star Wars my entire life. For the first time in a while, I just feel like a show is using the name ""Star Wars"" to milk a mid show with poor writing, poor acting and bad directing overall. It seems like a fan fiction that a confused teenager made last minute for a high school project that had to be in the Star Wars universe somehow. Holding out hope for the franchise because this just isn't it. Overall the actions and agenda pushing on this show feel so forced (no pun intended) and I just don't know if I have high hopes for the rest of the series. Excited for the future of the franchise tho! They been doing good with mandalorian and BoBF. Need more movies like Rogue One.",1.0

It's just plain, boring lackluster of a story. The characters in this show lack characteristics. The plot has more gaping holes in it than the finest of Swiss cheeses. When I watched this atrociously bad show, my thoughts through the episodes went like ""why?"" ""How?"" ""Those ppl would never do something like that"" ""what in the world"" ""that's not how the force works"" ""how do you burn stone?""I just want to unsee what I just saw.

" Call me when you do another Andor or Mandalorian.
",2024-06-05,"The Acolyte is the latest in the deluge of Disney+ Star Wars prequels. Taking place 100 years before the original Star Wars. It follows the emergence of the dark side of the force within individuals in the times before the evil Empire.Unfortunately this is yet another Disney+ Star Wars downgrade.Where did they find these actors? Many, not all, but many of the performances here, including by lead actor Amanda Stenberg, they just sound like they are reading their lines off the back of a cereal box. I honestly can't believe they left some of the takes in the show.The writing, as of the this review the first two episodes have been inflicted upon viewers and I honestly don't know what they are going for here. The writing is just bad in terms of the story and dialogue isn't any better. I don't understand why Disney is so against hiring actual professionals to make these shows.Lastly, unlike something like Andor that was shot on location, this is yet another lazily crafted Volume Soundstage production with no sense of verisimilitude whatsoever.I honestly don't know who this is for. In a cast full of teenagers and first timers, there isn't much of value taking place here, at least as of the first two episodes.I will say that Dafne Keen is pretty good. So there's that I guess. I may give this another episode or two and see if it gets any better, but so far it is not looking good.",3.0
" A Stunning Spectacle with a Story Lost in Space
",2024-06-05,"The latest sci-fi series, The Acolyte, is a frustrating paradox of technical brilliance and narrative incompetence. From the very first episode, it's clear that the production team spared no expense. The CGI is breathtaking, the sound design is immersive, the music is haunting, and the alien creatures are genuinely intriguing. Unfortunately, all of this is in service of a story that is, quite frankly, baffling.Halfway through the first episode, I found myself repeatedly asking ""why?"" Why are the characters making these choices? Why are these events unfolding in this way? Why should I care about any of this? I hoped the second episode would provide some answers, but instead, it only deepened the mystery. Now, I'm not only asking ""why"" about the plot, but also ""why"" I'm still watching.The Acolyte is a textbook example of style over substance. It's a visually stunning spectacle, but without a compelling story at its core, it's ultimately an empty experience. If you're easily impressed by flashy visuals and don't mind a nonsensical plot, then you might find something to enjoy here. But for those seeking a sci-fi series with substance and depth, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.",1.0

Star Wars fans are slowly starting to turn their back on the enterprise as a whole!The show demonstrates the visual affects can be achieved to a high standard, which is a shame because a decent director could have made something special here!

" Slowly killing off my dreams of wanting to be a Jedi ...
",2024-06-12,"Was born in 1971 and Star Wars was my first film I saw at the cinema and it has been an unashamed part of my life ever since...The original films will never be beaten and some recent films - rogue one , mandalorian, rebels , bad batch, Ashoka, andor /have been great. BUT... the problem with this franchise now is the amount of money it continually needs to generate and the younger audience it wants to captivate at the cost of the original and older fans. This series, so far, has almost been the ultimate insult to our loyalty and hopes of what could truly have been. Book of boba Fett was poor and the way Vader has been belittled with every appearance is criminal, but this series is next level rubbish. We don't need a lightsaber duel of force wielding every two minutes to be satisfied but what we really would like is good story telling, believable dialogue and captivating characters that we want to care about. Three episodes in at the time of this review and I have no enthusiasm to watch the next episode.Disney please, please take a look at your other major franchise (the Mcu) and realise that less is more. The films and series are too frequent and are made without the necessary quality control, direction and overall plan for fans to want (or even need) to follow. The proof is in the box office sales and they have been falling dramatically after endgame. This is now happening to this beloved Star Wars franchise and the Rot is starting to settle in and won't stop.We, as lifelong fans, don't need multiple spin offs, we just need quality over quantity. We want to watch the series and film and believe we can be part of that universe rather than looking at our watches to see how long the episode has left.I hate to ever criticise but I also find it unbelievable that there is a creative team and executives that have all got together and produced this pile of drivel.

" Decent show with potential
",2024-06-05,"As someone who is frustrated with Disney Star Wars and their recently creatively bankrupt ideas, I must say this is surprisingly alright. The fact it takes place outside the Skywalker Saga makes it better for me as we are seeing mostly original characters and no rehashing(hopefully) for the sake of fan service. 2 episodes are too soon to judge it fully but I feel like if the remaining 6 episodes are good, this show can be considered great or if they are mediocre or bad instead then this becomes just like Book of Boba Fett and the sequels. But all the 1's and 10's are straight up just two sides review bombing it positively and negatively. This show is nowhere near a 1/10 and also nowhere near 10/10. The fact is I like what I have seen so far.Another thing this show does do really well is the CGI and the species which are surprisingly good as well. I was shocked at how diverse and well made the species were considering the fact that the Grand Inquisitor was butchered in Obi Wan. I thought Disney were never gonna get past making ever creature look like a reskinned human. Overall, a decent but flawed start to a series that has potential.",7.0

Either all these actions will lead to a huge plot twist at some point in the series or....'ll spare me the rest.

People don't watch Star Wars to be reminded of what is happening in the world....they watch it to escape to another world and leave behind all their worries.Thank fully bad reviews like this will finally catch up to the individuals who make rubbish like this, and they will eventually become outdated and forgotten when studio bosses finally understand that allowing people to express their one sided agenda through movies and TV will result in monetary losses to the studio.",2.0

IP alone can't turn the work of inexperienced filmmakers into masterpieces - it needs to be backed by talent.Shogun is a great example of the type of quality and calibre of where Starwars needs to aim for.

" Another brainless and soulless cash grab.
",2024-06-12,"After watching the first three episodes of ""The Acolyte,"" I can honestly say that this series is not good. Despite the high expectations and the substantial budget backing it, the show fails to deliver on multiple fronts, leaving fans like myself deeply frustrated.One of the glaring issues is the baffling choices in character presentation. For instance, the inclusion of a shirtless Jedi feels out of place and unnecessary, breaking the immersion of the Star Wars universe. Additionally, the horrible old-man makeup on a Jedi character is distractingly bad, making it hard to take the character seriously, this also makes it clear that the people writing this show do NOT understand what Star Wars is about.The narrative is riddled with implausible scenarios that challenge the established logic of the Star Wars universe. A non-Jedi, non-Sith girl killing a more experienced Jedi Knight with a simple knife dagger is just one example. This undermines the established prowess and mystique of the Jedi, making it difficult to suspend disbelief.Another major plot issue is the scene depicting a fire outside a ship in space. Given the vacuum of space, this is scientifically impossible and breaks the fundamental rules of physics. Such glaring inaccuracies show a lack of understanding and respect for the science fiction elements that Star Wars fans hold dear.The writing on this show is among the worst I've seen in a Star Wars production. The dialogue feels forced and unnatural, and the plot progression lacks coherence and depth. It's astonishing that a series with such a significant budget can be this poorly executed.Comparisons to CW shows online have been frequent, and unfortunately, they hold true. In fact, many CW shows manage to provide better storytelling and character development than ""The Acolyte,"" which is quite damning given the resources and tons of money at Disney's disposal.The most disappointing aspect of ""The Acolyte"" is its wasted potential. As fans, we deserve much more than a show that feels like a subpar imitation of what Star Wars should be. It's not enough to slap the Star Wars label on a product and expect fans to accept it. The franchise has always been about compelling storytelling, rich characters, and a universe that feels alive and believable. This series fails on all those counts.In conclusion, ""The Acolyte"" is a major letdown. It fails to capture the essence of what makes Star Wars special, with poor writing, unbelievable plot points, and questionable character decisions. As a fan, I share the frustration and disappointment felt by many. It's time we demand better from such a beloved franchise. This show had so much potential, but we can't deceive ourselves into believing it's good just because it's branded with Star Wars. We deserve much more, and it's crucial that future projects understand and honor the legacy of this iconic universe.",1.0

" Worst Star Wars TV show to date
",2024-06-17,"I am not going to talk about the elements of production, direction, cinematography, etc. The only thing I will highlight is the Star Wars lore and canon that seems to be unknown to the people behind The Acolyte.The Force:-There are two essential elements to the force. The physical force (Which is used by force-sensitive beings in the form of offensive, defensive and neutral powers) and the cosmic force (Which escapes the control of any living being. It has its own consciousness and designates the destiny of the galaxy at will). With this in mind, whatever the defenders of this series may say, NOBODY, absolutely NOBODY can use the force to create or restore life to anything (In case you didn't know, NO. Palpatine wasn't telling the true to Anakin when he told him the story of Plagueis, he was LYING to make him doubt and turn him to the dark side. And that comic book vignette about Palps and Shmi... NO, Palpatine wasn't there to show us how he created Anakin with the force. That was a representation of how he was always close to him since he was born, watching him)-The chosen one is THE CHOSEN ONE precisely for the same reason I mentioned in the previous point. Anakin was created by the cosmic force to be the one who would give balance to the force, fulfill the prophecy and then cease to exist in the physical realm. The Acolyte does not take into account that no living being can create life, but yet these witches are so special that they surpass the power of any other being, even the most powerful physical representation of the force such as the Father. Not even he could go against the designs of the cosmic force to revive Ahsoka or save his own daughter's life, but somehow, the witches can create life. Let's say the cosmic force let them create life and make the twins. Whats their role? Is that important? They have to restore the balance to the galaxy like Anakin? Remember the force created Anakin because his task was EXTREMELY important and an inflection point for every single being in the whole universe. If it happens to be something like that, what's Anakin then? Not that special anymore I guess. If you doubt he is the chosen one, go re-read the canon, please.The Witches:-The speech that the witches have before the ritual highlights the oppression to which they were subjected and how they were unjustly accused of using unnatural practices, minutes later they proceed to use their dark magic to possess a Jedi who never attacked anyone... What? When the Jedi came to talk to them peacefully they proceed to threaten to cut out their tongues and go kill them in their sleep? Weren't they the oppressed, peaceful sorceresses? Weren't they the victims?AND WE'RE ONLY ON EPISODE 3If you still wondering why REAL STAR WARS FANS are so mad with this show and why they're rating it like they're doing, well... I don't know what else to tell you.",1.0
" Beware of Jedi Snobs & just watch for fun like you did once
",2024-06-07,It's Star Wars not The Passion of the Christ. Give it a chance I was engaged and enjoyed the first 2 episodes thoroughly. It's not Empire Strikes Back but if you just watch it for a bit of fun and don't expect too much then you will probably enjoy it. I thought the main character Mae was terrific and her opening fight scene with Trinity from The Matrix was epic.Disney is just trying to get younger generations into Star Wars. If some kid watches this and decides they want to watch everything Star Wars has ever created that's awesome I reckon. We need as many Jedi Masters as we can get right now in this crazy world 🌍,7.0
" Probably made by some stormtroopers ( you know why)
",2024-06-06,"Sadly the period in which the show takes places managed to lure me into watching it and give it a shot so to speak. I have my doubts with every Disney attempt to make something Star Wars related with the only exceptions being Rogue one, Andor and Mando season 1, but every other show or film had something to give it atleast a try and not be totally desatisfied with the experience until now.The Acolyte is the bottom that Star Wars can be hopefully never to be repeated...
The Plot is dull and i would again use the example that it looks like something made by the stormtroopers defeated by the Ewoks. The show has no logic at all, no character depth, no representation of the period in which it is set in.The actors seem dissapointed as well like playing an AD script, without much emotion or motivation.The sets looks cheap, espeacially for the bugget put into the show.The fights are comical as well as the jedi's on Olena and the Yorg one.I am very saddened to have to review Star Wars in this way, but this is an embarassment.

" The Art of Cringe
",2024-06-14,"You can't fake good writing. To write a good story, and especially interesting characters and dialogues, you need, besides talent, above all, hard work, really hard work. These days, wherever I look, writers mostly fail, and fail heavily: The Walking Dead franchise - dead. The Star Wars franchise - dead. The Star Trek franchise - dead. The Game of Thrones and The Lord of the Rings franchises - dead too. Some of these shows (prequels, sequels, movies, shows whatever) provide solid or decent productions and sometimes solid acting, but that's it. They all got one thing in common: they all lack heart and soul and creativity and the writing is not even at an acceptable mediocre level. The Acolyte is, in my opinion, one of the worst productions, and there are really already some bad productions in the Star Wars universe to this day. This has only one high level - in the art of cringe. I have read a lot of pulp stories and novels (sci-fi and other genres) in my life, but some of them are almost Nobel Prize candidates in comparison. Verdict: The Acolyte, especially the ""story"", is really bad; how this got green-lighted is beyond my imagination. I'm pretty sure, despite using fast-forwarding excessively, I still lost some brain cells watching this massive fail.",2.0

I don't understand why Disney can't come up with better shows (and movies). The only decent ones have been Andor, the Mandalorian, and Rogue One. Obi Wan had its moments but overall wasn't very good. In the post Disney era they have made great cartoons (Rebels and Bad Batch) and some great video games (Fallen Order and its sequel).

What's also cool is that you can only open the doors in the Jedi Temple using the Force. I wonder what others are doing? And ""The evidence is strong!"" with a dark tone.

I just want to enjoy another good story in the Star Wars universe, and feel we have been quite well spoiled with Star Wars TV content for some years now.I read that The Acolyte was not shot on The Volume as a number of SW shows have been. I have no complaints about The Volume btw, but the difference can be noticed. There's a more immersive quality to the shots and scenes which is quite enjoyable.It's fascinating viewing Coruscant and the Jedi Temple in earlier times, also interesting absorbing the culture of the Jedi with certain aspects recalling the Jedi culture in the prequel trilogy. Ranking hierarchies seem very prominent in their structure in this earlier period.I love the Jedi costumes. Its a nice change, and gives a more regal look.Sol is an instantly likeable and wise Jedi Master, despite being somewhat younger. He possesses some traditional qualities of a master, yet his character is meshed with his own empathy and uniqueness which I'm looking forward to seeing more.The story reminds me of some classic Clones Wars style investigative episodes. Mysteries, clue seeking, chases and solid action (excellent fight sequences and great uses of The Force which don't seem forced and silly), and all the while we get to enjoy character development and some good backstory filling. I like the pacing - not too fast, and not too slow.The ends of episodes 1 and 2 have mini cliff hangers, which engage and have us looking forward to the story evolving ahead.There's a more classic Star Wars feel to The Acolyte, and I'm enjoying it so far.

It really didn't make her seem like a master Jedi. So much of the writing is juvenile and the Jedi seem like the bad guys in the show. Everyone is constantly making stupid decisions, like thinking that Osha was the murderer when the entire crew of her ship could vouch for her being a half a galaxy away at the time of the murder. And then why doesn't the Jedi and his Padawan just escort her back to Coruscant? Instead, they put her on a broken down ship guarded by droids, and then somehow she survives a horrible crash.

What we need is a director who listens to fans at least a little bit because imagine if someone with the average Star Wars interests was directing a Star Wars show set in the high republic it would actually be amazing but instead we get this. Some of the actors are actually decent it's just that the directing is so unbelievably awful it takes away from their skill.",1.0
" Oh boy what did I just watch, how to ruin a franchise.
",2024-06-11,"Where to begin with the cinematic marvel that is ""The Acolyte""? Let's start with the writing, which is so wonderfully reminiscent of the golden age of television known as the CW era. It's like a nostalgic trip down memory lane to the days of melodramatic teen dramas, except this time with lightsabers and the Force.And the casting! It's as if they've discovered a secret Jedi mind trick to make us believe that age is but a number. The lead, a fresh-faced youth plucked straight from high school drama class, brings such a profound lack of gravitas to the role that you can't help but wonder if Yoda's famous quote was actually about her: ""Size matters not... unless you're trying to portray a complex character in a beloved space opera.""The other characters are no less intriguing, with performances that make you think they were chosen by a blindfolded droid playing pin the tail on the headshot. It's a bold strategy, Cotton; let's see if it pays off for them.Now, let's talk about the dialogue. It's as smooth and polished as a Hutt's backside. Take, for instance, the exchange during a fight scene that's so rich with subtext it could only be, ""Why are you here?"" ""To kill you."" Ah, brevity is the soul of wit, and this script is the soulmate of a Shakespearean sonnet.And who could forget the famous star wars roundhouse kick? Yeah I didnt remember ot was a thing. Because nothing screams ""galaxy far, far away"" like a roundhouse kick to the face. It's a refreshing change from the traditional blaster battles and lightsaber duels we've grown so tired of. After all, why stick to the classic STAR WARS formula when you can reinvent the wheel... and then set it on fire.In conclusion, ""The Acolyte"" is a masterpiece of mismatched elements, a tapestry woven from the finest threads of confusion and bewilderment. It's a bold new direction for the STAR WARS universe, one that says, ""Who needs coherence when you have chaos?"" Truly, the Force works in mysterious ways.",1.0
" A lot better than most other Star Wars series
",2024-06-05,"I am a huge Star Wars fan and I liked it. Full disclosure: I like almost all Star Wars, but there is a definite hierarchy in preference (OT is the gold standard). Also, Andor is the best series.The acting/writing/feel of the first 2 epsiodes of the Acolyte are much better than Obi-Wan and Boba Fett series. The writing is better than Mandalorian (although I do like the Mandalorian). This does not quite reach the level of Andor, but it is more true to the Star Wars feel, a combination of Prequels and OT.The Acolyte didn't cause me to cringe (unlike Obi-Wan/Boba Fett and even the Mandalorian on occasion), which maybe is a low bar (but even the prequels cause me to cringe sometimes).I am looking forward to the rest and hopefully it remains similar quality.",8.0

Despite the dialogue, which is a little childish at times, there's a solid storyline that makes me want to see how it all turns out.The set design is detailed and the special effects are good. I particularly liked the 'Trinity' opening fight scene with Carrie-Anne Moss, which had flavours of ""The Matrix"" to it.What disappointed me is that two of the top billed actors (no names mentioned) are no more. One of the reasons I was looking forward to the show was because of these two actors. I can only hope that they find some way to bring them back into the series - maybe flashbacks, or resurrection, or something.Anyone rating this 1/10 needs their head examined.

Forget about Star Wars angle, even non Star Wars fans will also find the writing and direction as very poor. Such bad approach of creative(?) team really makes it unbearable to watch and this by any means is not good for a franchise which has been loved by generations. If you feel so creative, make a series which has new characters, the characters and canon which is loved by the fans doesn't need such influence of someone who doesn't even know much about the star wars.

" Disney's 'The Acolyte': A Disjointed, Underwhelming Addition to the Star Wars Saga
",2024-06-11,"Disney's latest addition to the Star Wars saga, ""The Acolyte,"" is a disappointing effort that fails to deliver on its potential, leaving fans frustrated. Despite its ambitious premise, the series falters in almost every aspect, making it a difficult watch for dedicated Star Wars enthusiasts.The storytelling in ""The Acolyte"" is a mess, with a disjointed and poorly paced plot that drags on without meaningful progression. The narrative feels convoluted and confusing, leaving viewers more puzzled than intrigued. Characters, the heart of any Star Wars story, are severely underdeveloped and lack depth, with their actions often seeming inexplicable. This makes it hard to care about their fates.The dialogue is another major issue, riddled with clichés and uninspired lines that fail to capture the epic feel of the Star Wars universe. Moments that should be filled with tension and drama instead come across as flat and lifeless. The series' attempts at humor fall flat and break any sense of immersion.Visually, ""The Acolyte"" is inconsistent. Some special effects are impressive, but they can't make up for the lackluster set designs and uninspired cinematography. The series does little to explore new and exciting worlds, instead rehashing familiar settings without adding anything fresh or innovative. The production often feels low-budget, with cheap-looking costumes and lackluster practical effects.The cast, despite their best efforts, struggle with the material they're given. Talented actors are wasted on poorly written characters and uninspired dialogue, resulting in wooden and unengaging performances. The chemistry between the leads is virtually nonexistent, further diminishing the series' emotional impact.In conclusion, ""The Acolyte"" is a missed opportunity for Disney and the Star Wars franchise. It lacks the compelling narrative, strong characters, and captivating visuals that fans have come to expect. Instead of expanding the Star Wars universe in meaningful ways, it feels like a hollow, forgettable addition. The low-budget feel only exacerbates its shortcomings, making it hard to recommend ""The Acolyte."" Save your time and look elsewhere for your sci-fi fix.In summary, ""The Acolyte"" feels like the worst Star Wars project since the Holiday Special. It changes the Star Wars universe, the nature of the Force, and the canon that has come before, written by people with no respect for the franchise. Poorly written, acted, edited, and paced, the entire show appears to be a vanity project full of self-inserts rather than real characters. The decisions made by the characters break immersion constantly, and the concepts introduced seem whimsical with no reasoning behind them.The only positives are the production value, which is mostly okay for a show, along with the score and sound design. Sadly, the money spent on making this look and sound good is wasted on a poorly executed series. The dialogue is cringe-inducing, the story is confusing and nonsensical, and the acting is so poor it seems like the actors were found in a homeless shelter. Overall, ""The Acolyte"" is profoundly senseless and not worth the time.",1.0
" Sigh..... I just wanted Star Wars
",2024-06-12,"I mean they were handed one of the best stories and franchises in the history of the world, and they just threw it away. Instead of taking the story line and making a compelling show that the audience (who is extremely loyal to the Star Wars universe) would enjoy and understand, they hired a bunch of people who have no clue about Star Wars. Why in the world would you get people on the project that are not interested in Star Wars? The main actor was talking about how Anakin blew up the death star and at least one of the writers had never seen the show. I think we all know why, but that's an argument for a different platform.Overall, this is a travesty in terms of screenwriting and an actual show. The attempt to introduce a story line that is strictly to comply with a subsect of societal norms is astounding, but given it's Disney, not surprising and in line with Disney's work in the past few years.All we can hope for is that the terrible ratings and reviews of this show will send a message to Disney leadership to stop with the shenanigan's. Probably not, they are in their own world thinking they are doing 'good' things.Oh, and we should all start a petition to strike acolyte from Star Wars lore.

I hope they manage to keep things interesting as we learn more about our characters and the mystery widens. Amandla does a good job at portraying two characters as they feel pretty different from each other. Sol feels like the ultimate Jedi dad we all wish we could have, and I'm curious to see how the rest of the cast is fleshed out. It's nice to have a Star Wars show that's all new characters, mostly new locations, and isn't pandering to the audience by throwing recognizable things in their face.",7.0

" Disappointing Dive into the Dark Side
",2024-06-17,"As a long-time Star Wars fan, I was eagerly anticipating ""The Acolyte,"" hoping for a fresh and compelling exploration of the dark side of the Force. Unfortunately, the series fell short of expectations in almost every way.The storyline of ""The Acolyte"" is convoluted and lacks coherence. What could have been an intriguing narrative about the dark side's rise is instead a messy collection of half-baked subplots and confusing twists. The pacing is erratic, with some episodes dragging on without significant developments, while others rush through crucial plot points, leaving little room for character development or audience engagement.The characters in ""The Acolyte"" are one-dimensional and fail to evoke any emotional investment. The protagonist, who should have been a complex and compelling figure, comes across as bland and uninspired. The supporting cast is equally forgettable, with poorly written dialogues and lackluster performances that fail to bring any depth to their roles. The show also misses opportunities to explore the motivations and backgrounds of its villains, making them feel generic and unthreatening.While Star Wars is known for its stunning visuals and epic scale, ""The Acolyte"" disappoints in this department as well. The special effects are subpar, with several scenes looking more like a low-budget fan film than a professional production. The sets and costumes, though decent, lack the grandeur and attention to detail that fans expect from the Star Wars universe. Even the action sequences, which should be a highlight, are poorly choreographed and fail to deliver the excitement and intensity that they should.The writing in ""The Acolyte"" is one of its weakest points. The dialogue is often cringeworthy, filled with clichéd lines and awkward exchanges that break immersion. The direction lacks a clear vision, with inconsistent tone and style that make the series feel disjointed. The show also suffers from a lack of thematic depth, failing to explore the philosophical and moral questions that could have made it a richer and more engaging experience.Overall, ""The Acolyte"" is a major letdown for both Star Wars enthusiasts and general viewers alike. It squanders its potential with poor storytelling, weak character development, and unimpressive production values. Instead of providing a fresh perspective on the Star Wars universe, it feels like a forgettable and uninspired addition to the franchise. Save your time and look elsewhere for your sci-fi fix.",1.0

It's supposed to make us forget and escape daily life.Against all odds Disney did make the masterpiece Rogue One and Andor, which I regard as the actual prequels. And with the first two season of Mando, the story was flat but some nice dialogue and at least it felt like Star Wars. Like they actually learnt that the magic of Star Wars lies not in the movies itself but in nostalgia. It's not about special fx, it's a feeling, based on memories, the memories we have of the movies.

The creators like Tony Gilroy, Dave Filoni, and Jon Favreau are highly skilled individuals. However, this production is utterly disappointing. It falls short in various aspects such as acting, script, and direction. The storyline appears far-fetched, leaving much to be desired. I am deeply frustrated by the apparent insertion of LGBTQ characters solely for the sake of being ""trendy."" Furthermore, this narrative twist directly contradicts established lore, notably in Episode I where Anakin Skywalker's conception is portrayed differently. The absence of Yoda, who would have been approximately 700 years old during this period, raises serious questions. It is conceivable that Mr. Lucas may lament his decision to relinquish creative control to Disney. In my opinion, this is even more egregious than the infamous Star Wars Christmas Special.",8.0

" Worst Star Wars Media Yet.
",2024-06-07,"The Acolyte is the worst Star Wars cinematic release for several compelling reasons. First and foremost, the acting quality is disappointingly subpar, reminding the audience of a high school play rather than a professional television production. This significantly detracts from the immersion and emotional engagement of the audience. The technical aspects of the show also fail to meet expectations. The camera angles are poorly chosen, and the overall cinematography lacks the polish and creativity that fans have come to expect from Star Wars. These visual shortcomings are compounded by abysmal fight choreography. The action scenes are sluggish and rely on kung fu moves rather than the iconic lightsaber battles that define the Star Wars franchise. This stylistic deviation not only feels out of place but also diminishes the excitement and authenticity of the combat sequences.Perhaps the most egregious flaw of The Acolyte lies in its story. The narrative is poorly written and lacks depth, rendering it simply not engaging and forgettable. Adding insult to injury, the show shamelessly plagiarizes key plot points from the earlier Star Wars series, The Clone Wars. The central plot device of being framed for something she didn't do to the Jedi and the subsequent scene where the protagonist is cornered on a ledge, forced to choose between falling off or surrendering to the Republic, are blatant copies of the storyline involving Ahsoka Tano in The Clone Wars. This lack of originality and reliance on recycled plots not only disrespects the source material but also frustrates fans who are seeking fresh and innovative storytelling. I would not be surprised if this was news to the writer Leslye Headland as it's totally possible she hasn't even seen The Clone Wars.Overall The Acolyte fails on multiple fronts-from its lackluster acting and technical execution to its derivative and uninspired story. These shortcomings collectively make it the worst Star Wars cinematic release to date.",1.0

" Disappointing Start: ""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" Misses the Mark in First Three Episodes
",2024-06-12,"Review of the First Three Episodes of Star Wars: The AcolyteThe anticipation surrounding ""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" was palpable, with fans eager for a fresh perspective within the beloved galaxy far, far away. Unfortunately, the first three episodes fail to deliver the compelling narrative and rich storytelling that Star Wars aficionados have come to expect.From the onset, it's apparent that ""The Acolyte"" struggles to find its footing. The series diverges significantly from the core elements that make Star Wars captivating. The plot lacks the depth and substance needed to draw viewers into this new corner of the universe. The characters are underdeveloped, and their motivations feel contrived, resulting in a disconnect that makes it hard to care about their journeys.What's particularly frustrating is the missed opportunity. The Star Wars expanded universe is brimming with phenomenal content that could have been adapted into riveting storylines. The Bane Trilogy, Darth Revan, Darth Plagueis, and a young Palpatine are just a few examples of narratives that are rich with intrigue, complexity, and the dark allure of the Sith. These stories not only have a dedicated fan base but also offer a wealth of material that could have translated into compelling television.Instead, ""The Acolyte"" opts for a storyline that feels directionless and uninspired. The writing lacks the gravitas and intricate plotting that hallmark the best Star Wars tales. There is a noticeable absence of the epic, sweeping feel that fans crave, replaced by a series of disjointed events that fail to coalesce into a cohesive narrative.Moreover, the show does not capture the essence of the Star Wars universe. The mystical and philosophical underpinnings of the Force, the timeless struggle between the light and dark sides, and the rich lore that defines the galaxy seem lost in this rendition. It feels as though the showrunners have overlooked what makes Star Wars resonate so deeply with its audience.In conclusion, ""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" is a disappointing addition to the franchise. It squanders the potential of its setting and characters, offering a story that is both poorly written and lacking in substance. With an expansive library of exceptional source material at their disposal, it's disheartening to see such a missed opportunity. Fans of the saga deserve better, and one can only hope that future episodes or series will return to the high standards of storytelling that have made Star Wars a cultural phenomenon.",1.0
" It's really bad
",2024-06-17,"I came into the show with an open mind but the political agendas are too distracting. I just want to enjoy Star Wars. The acting is awful, the pace is too slow and inconsistent, there is no characters that stand out, much of the story is recycled. I am all for using new characters in a different timeline in a star wars universe but this has propaganda written all over it. Supposedly there was a 180 million dollar budget and that is very hard to believe as the sets are barren and boring. There is so many scenes that made me cringe, I would never post a review this early into the season but It's just really bad, subjectively of course.",1.0

But I tried to watch this as a neutral and well, it's just so boring. The acting across the board is terrible with the only decent line delivery coming from the 'Squid Games' guy who by all accounts doesn't really speak English (he's the most solid part of the show and I enjoyed his character), the rest are reading off prompts dotted around set, and they appear to struggle, The fight scenes, especially (and most disappointingly with Carrie Ann Moss) are weird and distracting where they've obviously been sped up to hide the inability of the performers. And well I guess, men are stupid, they've got good hearts some of the them regardless of specie, and only try to help but they're just stupid.

" Episode 3: The dark side of the Jedi
",2024-06-13,"I actually liked the first two episodes. I didn't mind wondering why in the universe that young woman killed Jedis. I liked the twin twist. I did not mind the mystery of unexplained background, it will be revealed, I thought.But now I am not happy about what was revealed.The Dark Side of the Jedi, authoritarian enforcers of some random power- and control-hungry laws. Wha?Must have missed that part of the lore in 9 Episodes plus offshoots.But wait, I DID dislike Jedi school. Not in itself, but they were all taken away from their families. So you get DV in the end, serves them right! Yoda and Grogu are the only decent ones after all.And now I DO mind not getting explained why Osha doesn't want to become a witch and ascend, but DOES want to train as a Jedi and leave her family, which she SO deplored losing in eps 1 & 2. Just because she says so is not a reason. Not enough of one. Curiosity? Okay, but a child that young cannot understand the consequences of such a decision. It has to be reversible.Just didn't like the storyline of how they were separated and how that small fire caused that much destruction.Hmph. Whatever.",
" A Star Wars story.
",2024-06-21,"This review is only covering up to the first 4 episodes. The Acolyte is setting up to be an interesting addition to the Star Wars story. It started out slow and has very much more characteristics of a tv show rather than a movie but is getting more intriguing. It remains to be seen if the loose ends are explained. One thing that seems absent is a memorable musical score that heightens scenes.It takes place a hundred years or so before the Phantom Menace, during the High Republic era. It's refreshing to see a different time explored. The Jedi were at there peak during this time. It should be an era of general peace so no galactic-level conflict should be expected. However it is setting up the beginnings of the plot to overthrow the Jedi and the Republic.A galaxy is large and with trillions of sentient beings, there are bound to be groups that take their own view and traditions of the Force. The Acolyte focuses on the story of a specific group of force users, or witches, which create the two main characters. This may actually better explain the origins of Anakin which was simply left as a virgin birth. The galaxy has quite a history so this is probably not the first time it happened either. It is interesting to see a progression of new abilities, but it is not always linear. So far this hasn't taken away from the original Star Wars movies. However if the alternate view of ""the thread"" replaces the Force, and people start saying ""may the thread be with you"" then it would no longer be Star Wars.Many negative reviews I read reveal that they simply don't like that the characters are not white, ore men. In a large galaxy it is expected to find all types of beings, and humans. I agree that Rey skipping the hero's journey was not good, but you have to judge the story.",7.0

" not so bad - but seems was made by people who do not understand Star wars universe
",2024-06-08,Killing a jedi master from the first episode by a acolyte basically puts the entire line of jedi masters in a very bad light. I mean the power of others padawan's like Anakin and Ahsoka - was much more impressive that master Indara. So in my view - those who wrote the script does not understand many things about jedi. They have to explain many things at the beginning and Master Yoda must be present in the first episode. Anyway - the expectations are high so they must change something.

Once dinner was complete. I watched it again on the big screen. My first thought was that I have seen fanfiction homemade films over the past two or three years that had better CGI and more engaging dialogue. I find it really strange that they give away the mystery , very early on and the rest of the time you're watching with very little suspense or surprise. Yes I could tear into this is being super girl boss and let's not get started about fire and space parentheses although Star Wars has always had a strange relationship with the laws of physics, And Lucas in his own words calls it science fantasy not science fiction ) After the second viewing, this thought came into my mind...

I really tried to give this a fair chance, then episode 3 !I honestly cannot think of any aspect of this production that doesn't fall into the negative rating. The wardrobe is even lackluster. The concepts are poorly thought out and constantly contradict themself. The acting seems phoned in, possibly due to poor direction, or just lack of talent. The writing is sophomoric and just bad. For example a fire starts burning in the vacume of space, oh and a giant fortress made primarily of stone and metal burns like its paper.The direction is a joke, or nonexistent. The dialogue is laughable, dialogue where characters contradict themselves. For example ""the thread (or force) is not to be weilded like a weapon"" only for the character that says this, to immediately demonstrate it being weilded as a weapon, only seconds after saying it is not to be weilded. Set design is poor. Seriously this looks and feels like a low budget production made by people with no qualifications in the industry. My question is how does this producer keep her job. The incompetence is astounding! For a while I hoped that someone would save the star wars franchise.

" Disney continues to not get it
",2024-06-07,"Like all Star Wars iterations coming out, I desperately wanted to see Disney show they listen to their fans and create something that feels more like the Star Wars fans grew up loving. Instead we are being given yet another rushed, oddly paced piece of media that makes it all too clear that the show runners have no idea what makes Star Wars interesting.The first episode starts out giving us a fight scene straight out of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (or I suppose the Matrix since they have Carrie-Ann Moss in the scene for a few minutes) with the characters fighting primarily in hand-to-hand combat. That is not too bad, except the fact that ALL fight scenes are done this way so far. Everyone is a martial arts master on top of being adept with the force and fighting with a light saber (even though Jedi were known to specialize in certain factors and were rarely shown to fight hand-to-hand). Then we go into smaller inconsistencies where they have an actual fire going on the outside of a ship in the vacuum of space, or how the main character straps herself into a seat while her ship crash lands into the atmosphere of a planet and hit the surface full force with her having absolutely no scratches to speak of.Then the pacing is all over the place. The way it is shown gives real ""and then"" vibes. Instead of instances leading into other instances as a result of consequence, the characters literally just let the plot push them along whether or not the actions and decisions make any sense. This thing happens, and then this thing happens, and then this character does this.I could speak more, but I feel this review is already long enough at the moment.

So other Star Wars female characters were not strong? Such us Padme, Ahsoka, Leia, Hera, Mon Mothma, Jyn Erso, Sabine Wren, Bo-Katan, even Rey at moments. At least they didn't need to wield that 'The Thread' power by sewing in the air with their hands (seriously, sewing?). Back in the day, perhaps 10 years ago, not just in Star Wars but in general TV shows and movies, there were just strong well-written characters, regardless of gender. And plain good stories.

Which probably isn't being fair to Charmed fans.While I think the one star reviews here are mostly hyperbolic. I understand the frustration.

Horrible contrived writing to separate the protagonist from her family.Honestly, you try your best to like the new Star Wars content but with a few exceptions (Rogue aone, Andor) they keep pushing us away.

" This is so bad that i cancelled my disney+
",2024-06-13,"Star Wars: The Acolyte"" has become one of the most anticipated additions to the Star Wars universe, but expectations have not been entirely met. The series has turned out to be a disappointment on several fronts.Firstly, the storyline is weak and disjointed. It promised to explore a new era within the Star Wars universe, but the end result feels superficial and unfulfilling. Character development is lacking, making it difficult to connect with the new figures. Their motives and backgrounds are poorly presented, leaving the audience with more questions than answers.Moreover, the series suffers from uneven production. The special effects are far from the standards we have come to expect from a Star Wars production. Some scenes feel cheap and half-finished, breaking the illusion and pulling the viewer out of the story. Costumes and set design sometimes appear just as sloppy, which is particularly noticeable in a franchise known for its attention to detail and world-building.The dialogues are another major weakness. Many of the lines feel flat and clichéd, lacking the sharpness and charm that previous Star Wars films and series have delivered. This contributes to making the scenes feel drawn-out and uninteresting.Another aspect that fails is the direction. It often feels like the actors are unsure of their roles, and their performances suffer as a result. Instead of creating engaging and memorable characters, most of them feel like they are just going through the motions.",1.0

Character motivations change from one scene to another based on the needs of the plot and still they do some of the dumbest things imaginable. There is a scene that has an escape pod full of prisoners picked up by security forces who know there are also surviving escaped prisoners on the planet below, but they leave, travel millions of miles to a headquarters of sorts and it's there they ask if they should go back to the planet and search for survivors.

The silly argument between ""true"" and ""fake"" SW fans is missing the point.

It's not high end, this show not meant to be that, more back to the usual adventuring and mission of the day type stuff.But there's potential for it to hit those marks IF it delves into the actual Acolyte herself, her master, his world.Seems so far that they are not the centerpiece of the show, but tha background storyline and characters to drive the focus on the jedi master and Osha.My expectation for this show before it released was just that....that they'd finally showcase the dark siders, their world, their struggles and everyday stories.

No, that is probably the least embarrassing part of this spectacle.The plot, if you could call it that, revolves around a ""mysterious assassin"" killing Jedi hundreds of years before the Prequel Trilogy. Sounds interesting, right? Unless, of course, the ""mysterious assassin"" gets revealed in the first episode. And from there, we are stuck to watch painstakingly stupid characters making unbelievably ridiculous decisions for almost 90 more minutes. That is honestly the show's biggest problem: it's writing.

" Fantastic Premise & Good Action Sequences hampered by poor writing, direction, production and PR
",2024-06-19,"The main premise behind the show, is a really, really good one. In a Universe as large as the Star Wars universe there must be an almost infinite number of cultures with different moral codes, differentiated hierarchies of values and various faith systems. Of course that means there will inevitably be conflict when it comes to what may even be seen as minor differences in morality, doctrine or belief. Never more so than when there are differences between fanatical sects of a religion (shia and sunni anyone?) This seems to be the case in this story, with the Jedi and the Witches being differing sects of the same faith system, which have a history of serious doctrinal disputes.What a fantastic and relatable premise to build upon! Problem is, the writers, directors and production teams did not do a good job of building on this premise. They did a bad job. A very, very, very BAD job. For a more detailed summary of the travesty that is production of The Acolyte, see my review of episode 3. Essentially, the writing and the whole production is so dismal it remains impossible to suspend disbelief (most essential when watching sci-fi or fantasy) long enough to make it through an episode. How did this happen? How did this make it through such a long production process and no-one had the courage to stand up and say ""This is Bad!"" How do they sit down as a cast and crew to watch this production and not have someone, not ONE person, say ""Uhhhh... yeah. I think we need to rethink this whole thing.""At this point, there is very little I can add to an already well beaten horse. However after reading so many reviews and watching so many videos on the series I feel I can shed some light on the source of the controversy:The source of the controversy surrounding the show must be traced back to the echo chamber or bubble in which its creators seem to exist. In this bubble, certain eccentric themes and perspectives are universally embraced and pedestalized. Here, the writers, directors, and production teams have failed to deliver a compelling and well-executed story with more universal themes that appeals to a broader audience. In this bubble no one dares disagree or criticize ""the work"".The media appearances of the creators and cast of The Acolyte have been an additional source of controversy, with some comments being interpreted as being spiteful toward the fanbase. These appearances have further alienated many existing fans, who feel that their concerns and perspectives are not being taken into consideration by the creative team behind the series.The Acolyte had the potential to be an engaging and thought-provoking exploration of the conflict between differing sects of a religion in the Star Wars universe, the poor writing, direction, and production quality of the show, combined with its appearance of catering to a specific demographic at the expense of a broader audience, have resulted in a polarizing response to the show and a significant backlash from the existing fanbase.",2.0

How are these people going to know how to get our attention and how to show the spirit Star Wars means???I honestly discourage anyone from watching this waste of time.

The franchise can't grow with the same stories and ideas being replayed. The Mandolorian, Ahsoka and Andor have demonstrated that you can come up with new ideas, characters and plot lines that enhance the franchise.

D&D must be relieved that their butchery of Game of Thrones ending is nothing compared to this.We all want new Star Wars material.

People say the fan base is divided, but is it? Everyone I speak to loves season 1 & 2 of Mando, agrees on the brilliance of Andor and Rogue One, and even with episode 7 most agree was fine to good, just too similar to what we've seen before (A copy and paste). The fans are in agreement with the material that hasn't worked too, and oh boy, this is up there.Aesthetically, spiritually and conceptually, this is not Star Wars.

You need a good look in the mirror and people need to start losing jobs. I would give this zero out of ten but it wont let me go that low.,1.0

Is it really that bad?Regardless of the script, which many consider weak, I'd say that the acting, costumes, special effects and the general quality of this series are top of the class. Way way better that the lowest score anyway you put it and also much better than a 3.3 average. Not the best I've seen, but definitely something I'll watch. Well worth my time.

",2024-06-10,"Honestly, I went into these first 2 episodes hope-filled and wanting something--anything--good to come out of it. But what we got was nowhere near what I hoped for. I should have known better. On first watch-through I thought the episodes were okay, but after a second viewing I had taken off the rose-colored glasses and was more critical of what was on the screen. And.... I didn't like what I saw at all. By this point, we all know Disney has this history of ""Strong female character"" and ""dumb as rocks male character"" as valid concepts to build a series or movie on, but this is ridiculous. The Obi-Wan series was, I thought, the low point, but I was wrong. Book of Boba Fett beat it out. Then comes the Acolyte saying ""Hold my beer and watch this"" as it swan-dives into literal stupidity, bad acting, bad writing, and sets that look small and cheaply made. Where is the grandeur? Where is the ""Star Wars"" epic scope? Nowhere to be found. Normally, I save a ""4"" score for ""if only they tried harder, they would have been average fare,"" so this has to get a 3--a nice way of saying ""what the heck is this?"" Me and two of my friends, after a night of heavy drinking, could write a better episode than this with so little effort there would be more time for drinking when we were done with the first draft.

Visually it's quite good, there are some scenes that you can clearly tell its CGI whereas in other star wars media it looks incredibly real (I'm not talking about the movies). The combat scenes are also bad, with clunky combat and long pauses so that the characters can look at each other dramatically, which takes away from the combat and makes it boring, when combat is meant to be the most exciting part of the series.

It's a ho-hum agenda pushing adventure with mythological convolutions that fail to engage.Failed Formulaic Prequel: Not all sagas need endless prequels, and ""The Acolyte"" proves this point. It adds nothing fresh while also ruining the core of what started the whole saga to begin with.Logical Fallacies: Critics have pointed out logical inconsistencies, hokey dialogue, nonsensical plots, horrible acting, and an extremely apparent ""message"" that the show is trying to push. It feels mishmash at best.Audience Dissonance: Critics and audiences are miles apart on this one. While critics have praised it (Clearly paid for...), audiences have given it a harsh 18%!!! Score on Rotten Tomatoes (at this time).In summary, ""The Acolyte"" struggles to recapture the magic of the original trilogy. It will be a forgettable addition to the Star Wars universe (other than how terrible it is), running on fumes rather than the Force (or the ""thread"", LOL are you kidding..).

It's clear they either haven't seen any of the original work or any of the extended star wars content.On a purely entertainment level, the acting is awful, mainly i think because of the 5th graders who wrote the script.

" Possibly the most poorly written Disney Star Wars show to date.
",2024-06-12,"To be honest. This show really isn't even worth the time it would take to rip into it and give an extensive review on. I think anyone who watches this can easily see (regardless if your a big SW fan or not) how absolutely atrocious the writing is. Almost everything is so poorly done, the acting from many of the actors is poor, the dialogue is generic most of the time and awful at others. The main character is unlikable and uninteresting, the writers go out of there way to make the Jedi to look like complete fools and straight evil oppressive villains. It goes against cannon and established lore on multiple accounts, and not just in small minor ways, oh no... it goes above an beyond what I would have ever expected. The set designs and costumes are poor, looking fake nor authentic to the SW universe in the slightest. If you're a SW fan that's already checked out of the franchise like I have and aren't phased any longer by this type of modern slop, you might find it unintentionally humorous.

outside of psychokinesis and laser Sabers and Kung Foo Masters I can flip 100 movies that exist into ""Star Wars"".So if Disney wants to make some new character they already killed Marvel so throw her into Marvel.(What's with the three year hiatus between seasons good or bad)?1. This takes place 100 years before those horrible prequels and there's no Yoda? Even with slow aging per the Mandalorian the Yoda would be early 800's and should be a Jedi.2.

",2024-06-12,"Whilst some criticism for The Acolyte is understandable (a few inconsistencies here and there etc); I have found the show to be quite enjoyable. The new era definitely helps this. I find I'm not worried about how everything relates to the main saga or how it can hurt it. Instead I'm able to watch a Star Wars themed show without too many attempts to throw cameos at me or link itself to something else. I'm sure in time, it will do so, but for now the story feels relatively new. I haven't been awestruck yet, but I have managed to emotionally attach to the show's leads unlike other viewers.The characters feel relatively settled in and although more development is needed, I'm sure that will come with time. Each episode has so far contained something intriguing or interesting to keep me attached. Though I am still on the fence about this series' potential, it still has promise to become a great show. There has been criticism that the show is overly political, though Star Wars has always been intensely political as most works of arts are. Whilst I can see some of the messages gaining criticism, I believe they are generally well wrapped in the narrative and do not splurge over into being clumsy additions unlike some previous works.I do however, respect the criticism coming towards the show, I say all this as a big critic or Disney's Star Wars era, though I am of the opinion that the show's we have seen produced have generally been at worst ""passable"" and at best ""excellent (looking at you ""Andor""). In this sense, I find them a lot like the old expanded universe stories. Some are fantastic, some are good and some less so. Without George Lucas at the helm (with a strong team), the Star Wars we get now will be different and will definitely evolve. I just hope it ages gracefully.I hope like me, fans both new and old will continue to view these productions with an open mind. This show represents a chance for Star Wars to grow. If this show can be nurtured and continues to grow well, we as current fans and new fans in the future can still have a chance at new Star Wars stories both with freedom to express whilst having loyalty to the original concept. It is in that comment I realise I'm perhaps being a tad optimistic. But nevertheless, I believe the show is worth a watch.

While she's at it, gotta represent that 3% and replace ALL the dough with a gluten free version.Well, the pizza chefs don't like it, but she replaces them, even though many came from Italy and have been cooking pizza for decades. She hires people that used to work at Saladworks that admittedly never even ate pizza. Perfect!Customers criticize the changes. She says they're all just old white carnivores that don't like diverse palate representation. Doesn't matter that they represent 90% of the revenue over the last 40 years. We are focused on vegans and gluten free consumers.Sales tank. Reviews deep below even Biden/Harris approval ratings. Customers say, we don't care about this stuff, we just want good pizza!Any sane corporation would fire this CEO, apologize to the customers that she insulted and alienated and drove away, and we'd be seeing good pizza come back again.This Acolyte series is the worst kind of gluten free, fake cheese, tofu topping, impossible beef pizza getting pushed to us by writers with as much of a clue about good science fiction story writing as a Saladworks worker knows about smoking a brisket.",1.0
" Good show for the W Network
",2024-06-16,"OK, I get the fact that women have been underused in Hollywood and in TV series, but they are now being overused in roles of strength and power. Interestingly, while trying to show that women have great leadership capabilities, many of them are shown as having an evil side instead of an endearing and likeable one. I'm sure the Star Wars franchise has many female fans, and this is obviously meant for them. The script is too weak to be propped up by the best of CGI, and in general is dull and boring, with overly dramatic acting only adding to the misery. After the first two episodes I forced myself to watch the third. I will not make the same mistake again. Originally these Star Wars spin-offs were intended to introduce the early lives of characters who would played major roles in the franchise. The characters in The Acolyte do not seem to be related to the original series, and this show now is even questioning the morality of the Jedi, who, except for those who turned to the ""dark Side' like Vader, were previously the saviours of the Empire. I am fully aware that this is pure fantasy, and can go any direction it wants to, but it still should be entertaining. I'm not sure where The Acolyte is going, and frankly Verosha, I don't give a damn.",1.0

The writing is god awful, once again everything is explained in dialogue instead of being shown, just plain lazy writing. The fight scene with Carrie-Anne Moss is god awful, Matrix-esc fighting in Starwars doesn't make sense. Force pushing tables with feet, leaping around like there's no gravity... she has a lightsaber and doesn't even use it to defend herself or the other people in the cantina. The biggest fail is when they are talking about Carrie-Anne Moss's murder and assume the main character committed it because ""The evidence is overwhelming""... What evidence?! The bar man said so?!

" Had potential, but still surprised by poor quality.
",2024-06-07,"The special effects were surprisingly bad for a production like this. It distracted from the many other shortcomings evident in the first couple of episodes. It tends to be schoolyard story drama, perhaps it should have been called Jedi High Blues. Lesley Headland has penned a promising story, but seems to have lost me at hello. It doesn't help that everyone has turned on Disney, but still, Andor was a strong story which had little to do with the original story arcs, and it was faithful enough to win over the loyal fans across the 47 years of established storytelling and lore, not to mention the Mandalorian, and the best Disney era Star Wars movie in Rogue One. No, Headland is not convincing me that she understands what the paying public want, and her vision for the Star Wars universe is flawed at best. So the potential wasted may simply be a case of another writer/director manifesting the Disney vision.",1.0

Good storytelling with believable characters, great chemistry, and just enough winking humor to not let things get too heavy handed.I feel genuine sympathy for all those guys who haven't searched their feelings before trolling judgment on this show.

" Don't agree with what everyone is saying. IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD!
",2024-06-06,"I don't want to say STAR WARS IS BACK but I'm possibly on a path to. I've only watched the first episode but here's my review already, and I think it's a good one so please give it a read. I'd like to start with what I didn't like since it, of course, isn't perfect but again, this is a review based off of the first episode only.The first fight scene was quite obviously written with women empowerment in mind, which is okay since it also introduces us to the villain and was still bad-ass and fun to watch. It's just annoying as seeing women beat up men alone is no longer impressive or original and we've seen it so many times in Star Wars with the COLOSSAL amount of significant and powerful female characters, and so it's a shame that the makers of this show think that it's necessary to include such things with such intentions, and i'm pretty sure the makers of this show have actually said there's not enough women in star wars or something that proves a lack of interest in the very diverse franchise. I also don't feel like some of the portrayals are capturing the essence of someone that lives in the galaxy of Star Wars, and are coming across a bit too normal mostly because of how a lot of the characters are speaking quite common without any unique accents, it's as if there's been an influx in Londoners that have migrated to the Star Wars universe. One of the actors early on in the episode was literally doing soap-opera acting which was actually quite hard to watch. It's hard to explain but at the beginning, for example, Osha seemed a bit too ordinary, like someone you'd meet on the street or in a queue at Greggs, which is unusual to me for star wars where you have legendary beings with a powerful aura such as Obi-Wan Kenobi etc.NOW! I cannot stress how much I am LOVING being back in the prequel era!!! 100 years is nothing in the timeline of Star Wars and so I'm feeling so close to the prequel trilogy in terms of characters, setting, CGI, writing and more. It's making me feel this real nostalgic joyousness. My favourite so far is, without a doubt, Master Sol. He reminds me a great deal of Qui-Gon, a wise jedi, not on the council, who doesn't always agree with their decisions and loyally follows the force that he is ever so powerful with, and it wouldn't surprise me if Qui-Gon was inspired by him. Moreover, the plot is already compelling me, and whoever has written this series should teach the writers of TBOBF or Mandolorian Season 3 some stuff. Right out of the first episode we already have layers of details about characters, a journey embarked on, mysteries to be discovered and questions to be answered, and I actually can't wait for the second episode which I'd like to watch right now, but I have an English GCSE tomorrow (I watched it anyway). The force is great as well! It's back to feeling like a mythical power that only the highly trained and powerful can weild, and not any old lump who closes their eyes and ""Trusts their instinct"" or ""Reaches out"" (""cough-cough SEQUELS cough-cough"").All-in-all, it has serious potential, on a level no other recent star wars production has had, to be one of the greats, and I honestly think it's mostly to do with it not only being prequel era, but further back in time than ever before and IN LIVE ACTION! Hope it doesn't head downwards, but I'm keeping expectations low.",7.0

" Dismantled a legacy for a quick buck
",2024-06-16,"Shameless writing, in short Star Wars touches a lot of people because of it's deep story telling, and hero and struggle tropes that resonates with everyone that really listens because we face the same inside of us, a battle against good and evil, light and dark. A fantasy told well reveals the things inside of us that are the most true. This series writing arc, does none of that, couldn't care less and seems only to tear down a grand story that has done more to unite people, promote inclusion and inspire than the entire movements that are intent on taking over (with hatred and prejudice) whatever good things they can find.Leave it alone, get out, every franchise isnt a political beating drum. When you take stories that bring people together in a wonderful way, you can't come in with a hateful rage of divisiveness and tear it all down. There's is no credibility to that thinking here.It's like starting a side story of blues clues and saying blue was really a communist, with a blue superiority complex, but it's ok, it has better be OK or else, and no he doesn't help teach kids shapes anymore and we should be ok with that too...

And the same goes for the overall look (Venestra, as an example) - it looks like a fanpic from twenty years ago.And I'm sad to say most main characters (except maybe master Sol) is plain dull. Yord (with his shirtless scene for no obvious reason) is one of the worst part, together with Venestra (a cosplay gone wrong). And the fighting style?

The plot feels disjointed, with numerous inconsistencies and lazy storytelling. The characters are one-dimensional and fail to evoke any emotional connection. You can tell they were only selected for diversity. It's evident that the writers did not invest enough effort into understanding the rich lore and complex dynamics that define the Star Wars universe.

I'd say a lightsaber is more dangerous than a normal knife).Then, we arrive at the horrendous episode 3. What can be said about this defamation of Lucas's work? It paints the jedi as evil idiots, it completely destroys the concept of the force and of the chosen one because, guess what, some random witches can create TWO force sensitive beings, whereas Darth Plagueis couldn't even manage to create one (he tried to create the ultimate dark side entity, but the force did the exact opposite).Finally, there's episode four.

" The series The Acolyte completely deviates from what defines Star Wars, and I cannot recommend it.
",2024-06-21,"The series The Acolyte completely deviates from what defines Star Wars, and I cannot recommend it.The original films from the '70s and '80s were magical and epic, centered around the hero's journey and themes of perseverance, friendship, redemption, and even love. They captured the imagination with their timeless storytelling and iconic characters. The prequels from the 2000s, despite having pacing issues and losing some of the original mystique, still managed to deliver memorable scenes and moments that resonated with fans. However, the recent movies have been plagued by poor narrative choices and an implausible plot, which is disappointing even for a science fiction series.Regrettably, these shortcomings have been carried over to The Acolyte. The series lacks the cohesive storytelling and character development that made the earlier films so beloved. It feels disconnected from the core essence of Star Wars, failing to evoke the same sense of wonder and adventure. The plot is convoluted, and the narrative decisions are questionable, making it difficult to engage with the story or care about the characters.While the Star Wars universe has always been a blend of fantasy and science fiction, it still relied on a certain level of internal logic and consistency, which The Acolyte seems to disregard. This series does not capture the spirit of the franchise and instead feels like a misguided attempt to expand the universe without understanding what made it special in the first place. For fans who cherish the original magic and epic storytelling of Star Wars, The Acolyte is likely to be a disappointment.",1.0
" Wow, I liked it. I think it's a solid addition
",2024-06-18,"I love sci-fi, Star Wars was the biggest thing in the universe to me when I was a kid. I go to SD Comic-Con. I watch every Marvel movie and even most DC.The Acolyte is pretty good, I'm really enjoying it and so are my kids.To me, action is very important, and I love the action in The Acolyte. I read some people don't like the martial arts theme, but I love it. Some people think that ""breaks"" Star Wars, but it makes sense to me. It's 100 years before Star Wara so the Force, how people fight, hasn't evolved into what it in Episode 1. The different fighting styles and skills (force shields, hand to hand combat mixed with force pushes) makes sense to me and I find cool.The visuals are gorgeous, it's one of the most fantastic looking high production value shows I've ever seen on streaming. I want to keep seeing shows with big budgets, amazing scenes, with great fighting. MORE OF THIS.Yes, some of the acting is mediocre and Disney needs to up its standards. Everyone is starting to think every chubby non-athlete can be an action star and I'd caution Disney to get people who can move in action movies. But it's great action and effects, keep it coming.If you love gorgeous visuals, sci-fi and action, I think you will find The Acolyte very entertaining. I honestly wonder if some people are trying to review bomb the show because it features a black woman and was produced by women, because the truth is, if you love sci fi and action and you don't care who produced it, you will enjoy this a lot.",8.0
" Cool concept. Let's see where this goes!
",2024-06-08,"So, a lot of bad reviews already after two episodes. I must agree that some choices are very weird and that jedi seem to have no autonomy when it comes to making decissions. And indeed: Everyone escapes or dies way to easily. There are actually too many ways to escape from a prison cell, for example.But still, I like the places they visit, I actually do like the protagonist and I can watch it as a fairy tale instead of a story that everyone checks for all possible inconsistancies. Force twins are cool and master Sol is cool. I even like the stuck up jedi because surely there must be some stuck up jedi amongst the jedi? And misses Keen is doing a good job as well, except where her dialogue is meant as expo (like the question about clinging to the past). I also like the pace at which the jedi are dying. Sure, the first one died way to easy but the way the second one died was actually pretty cool. Also: bureaucracy being part of the jedi was their downfall, right? So we see that here as well. It is what takes away the autonomy and you feel it.Anyway, everything depends on how things develop. It isn't Shakespeare.but it is okay. It isn't Andor but it is fun. And thank whomever that it IS colorful. At some time, not everything must have been bland. If you want SW to be beige, just watch all the desert scenes.",7.0
" This marks the end of Star Wars as we know it today.

The actors in this will always be remembered for how bad it is and for being the ones who ruined Star Wars.I will never watch this again; it was painful to endure. I cringed multiple times and often found myself zoning out, reminiscing about the original Star Wars movies that paved the way for this destruction. The charm, depth, and magic of the original saga seem completely lost. The storytelling, character development, and even the special effects, which once set a gold standard in cinema, have now been reduced to mere shadows of their former glory.EA and Disney are ruining Star Wars, and it's truly sad. The passion and dedication of George Lucas and his team have been replaced by what feels like a cash-grab mentality, sacrificing quality and the essence of Star Wars for profit. It's disheartening to see such an iconic franchise being dismantled piece by piece, alienating long-time fans and tarnishing the legacy of a cultural phenomenon. The actors involved will always be associated with this downfall, remembered not for their talent but for their roles in what many consider the decline of Star Wars.

" Star Wars: Acolyte - A Disappointing Addition to the Galaxy
",2024-06-12,"As a long-time Star Wars fan, I was eagerly anticipating the release of ""Star Wars: Acolyte."" Unfortunately, the series has proven to be a major letdown in almost every aspect. Despite the potential for an intriguing story set in a largely unexplored era, ""Acolyte"" falls flat with its weak plot, lackluster characters, and inconsistent pacing.The story, which promised to delve into the dark side of the Force and the rise of the Sith, is disappointingly thin and predictable. Instead of providing a fresh and engaging narrative, it recycles tired tropes and fails to offer any meaningful insights into the Star Wars universe. The plot progression feels disjointed, with numerous subplots that either go nowhere or are resolved in an unsatisfying manner.Character development is another major issue. The protagonists are bland and forgettable, lacking the depth and complexity that made characters in previous Star Wars installments so memorable. The supposed villain, meant to be a menacing and formidable presence, comes off as one-dimensional and unconvincing. Even the performances by the cast, who seem to be trying their best with the material they were given, cannot save these poorly written characters.The pacing of the series is also problematic. The episodes drag on with unnecessary exposition and filler scenes, making it a chore to sit through. Action sequences, which should be a highlight in any Star Wars production, are few and far between and lack the excitement and spectacle one would expect. When the action does occur, it feels rushed and poorly choreographed.Visually, ""Acolyte"" does have some redeeming qualities with its impressive special effects and set designs. However, these are not enough to compensate for the series' numerous shortcomings. The overall aesthetic, while polished, cannot mask the lack of substance and engagement in the storytelling.In conclusion, ""Star Wars: Acolyte"" is a disappointing addition to the franchise. It fails to live up to its potential and delivers a forgettable and uninspired experience. Fans of the galaxy far, far away deserve better than this lackluster series. Save your time and rewatch the classic Star Wars films or explore other expanded universe content instead.",1.0

" Shortcomings are far too many

They draw you in from great acting, cinematography, or a superb story line. Well this sadly and definitely is not one of those times. The characters are lackluster and the story is drawn out already The actors are like trick-or-treators and the costumes are cute, but simply not believable and they do not pull you in.Part ways through you find yourself simply not caring for the development and hoping the characters would get replaced. Star Wars used to have such emotions and great progression with character nuances and great metamorphosis. Now they are bland and just there occupying space without any true fire and emotion.This makes me want to go back and watch and appreciate the older movies and Star Wars even more now. This is what happens when politics come into play, you lose sight of the forest from the trees and end up not caring about the trees nor the forest/",1.0
" A colossal disappointment for the Star Wars franchise
",2024-06-17,"""The Acolyte"" is a massive letdown for the Star Wars franchise, failing to impress on almost every level. The visuals are disappointing, with scenes that look entirely like they were filmed in front of a green screen, giving the show a cheap and artificial appearance. The costumes are equally poor, resembling low-quality Halloween outfits rather than the attire of formidable dark side users.The acting is another significant issue. The performances are wooden and uninspired, making it seem as though the actors were handed their scripts right before filming. This results in characters that are flat and unengaging, which makes it difficult to invest in the story. The plot attempts to introduce original elements but fails to maintain any continuity with the established Star Wars universe, leaving fans feeling disconnected and frustrated.Moreover, the writing and direction are subpar. The narrative is incoherent, with illogical sequences that make it hard to follow or care about the story. Despite some effort in choreographing action scenes, the lack of emotional weight and poorly developed characters undermine these moments.Additionally, ""The Acolyte"" seems more focused on pushing ideological agendas than delivering a compelling story. This heavy-handed approach alienates the core fanbase and detracts from the overall enjoyment of the series. The result is a show that feels more like a parody than a serious addition to the Star Wars saga.In summary, ""The Acolyte"" is a poorly executed series, plagued by substandard visuals, weak performances, and a disjointed plot. It fails to capture the magic of the Star Wars universe and is likely to leave fans deeply disappointed.

However, my enthusiasm quickly turned into disappointment as the show unfolded.Lackluster Storytelling:
""The Acolyte"" suffers from a lackluster and often incoherent storyline. The narrative meanders without clear direction, making it difficult to become invested in the characters or their journeys. The pacing is erratic, with some episodes dragging on without any significant plot progression while others rush through important events without giving them the depth they deserve.Uninspired Characters:
The characters in ""The Acolyte"" are forgettable and poorly developed. Despite a potentially rich background, the protagonists lack depth and motivation, making it hard to connect with or care about their fate. The antagonists, while visually striking, are one-dimensional and fail to bring any real sense of menace or complexity to the story.Visual and Production Issues:
While Star Wars is known for its groundbreaking visual effects, ""The Acolyte"" disappoints in this department. The CGI is inconsistent, with some scenes looking polished while others appear surprisingly amateurish. Additionally, the set designs and costumes often feel recycled and uninspired, lacking the creativity and attention to detail that fans expect from the franchise.Weak Dialogue and Acting:
The dialogue in ""The Acolyte"" is often stilted and cliché-ridden, failing to capture the wit and charm that have characterized the best of Star Wars. This is compounded by uneven performances from the cast. While a few actors manage to deliver solid performances despite the weak material, others seem lost, either overacting or delivering lines with a wooden, disengaged demeanor.",1.0

I have no clue where the money went to be frank, because it didn't go towards hiring any talent as far as acting goes.

" Star Wars is dead, and this is the show that finally ended it
",2024-06-14,"I want to caveat this review and say I'm an OG Star Wars fan, I have the books, the toys, the Lego sets... it was one of the reasons I fell in love with sci-fi. So despite the franchise's incredibly hit & miss recent TV offerings, I tried with The Acolyte. I really tried to give this a go... but it's a mess, from virtually any perspective - Whether you're a fan or not.The main thing is just how heavy handed it is with two things: the first is absolutely nonsensical storytelling and bad decision making from characters ( a trait in all the recent SW TV shows). And the second, and the one that really just grates, is retconning the history of the Star Wars (The Force in particular) to make it fit a DE&I message that it seems the directors and showrunners were intent on making for themselves.Those two issues dominate the show and as a result, you simply can't just enjoy it. You question why things happen because they're utterly so ridiculous (examples: stone is apparently the most combustible material in the galaxy. It makes sense to put a hideout on top of a tall mountain and make it instantly visible to anyone. Squid Game Jedi sees someone killed in front of his very eyes, but yet then tells another character he believes her when she think she's alive... I really could go on).I endured the first three episodes of this dross but I'm done now. Not just with the show, but with Star Wars in general. This isn't the spectacle I grew up with and came to love... it's being hijacked by people with no creative or storytelling ability to promote and retcon their own agendas into, and that's just sad.I gave it two stars only because of one thing: and that's seeing Carrie-Anne Moss again who's a brilliant actress... even though she was criminally underused and done a dirty by the story.",2.0

I would enjoy it more if it went at a slower burn from now on.I appreciate some of the themes addressed in the Acolyte: it is clear it has a more critical take on the role of High Republic Jedi as police, a logical step given what we have seen in the sequels. There is a good conversation brewing about who deserves and wields power, and I hope the rest of the series continues to explore that.I also want to address the number of bogus reviews I've seen on this site.

" A Dimly Lit Tale of Politics Over Plot
",2024-06-21,"""The Acolyte"" promises intrigue and mystical allure with its premise centered around witches and dark powers. However, the series fails to deliver a compelling narrative, getting caught up in political undertones that feel more preachy than integral to the storyline.The lead actress, portraying a novice in her mystical journey, unfortunately, mirrors this inexperience in her performance. Her portrayal lacks the depth and complexity expected in such a dark and twisted setting, which could have added a significant layer to the overall atmosphere of the series.Furthermore, the show's attempt to weave a dark witches' storyline, while conceptually appealing, ends up feeling overly grim and lacks the necessary nuance to make the darkness feel meaningful or thrilling. Instead, it comes across as merely gloomy and oppressive without much payoff.In conclusion, ""The Acolyte"" struggles with its execution and thematic integration, leaving much to be desired. The series leans heavily into its political messages at the expense of storytelling, resulting in a viewing experience that feels more like a lecture than an engaging narrative. Those looking for a richly woven tale of magic and mystery might find this series underwhelming.",1.0

Note to Disney: Stop hiring those who insult your entire fan base with ad hominem attacks, and start making entertaining products the kids can enjoy without being groomed into your worldviews.

But oh no, a tribe of witches on a forgotten planet can produce children at will. ""He could influence the midi-chlorians and create life"", Palpatine said about Darth Plagueis in an attempt to seduce Anakin to the dark side of the Force, implying that this amount of power is extremely rare and potentially unattainable by anyone other than the Chosen One.At the same time this show and the audience's reaction to its gross misinterpretation of the Force is a new hope for the franchise.

Balance had to be brought to Disney+.I'm used to the bad dialogue, bad acting, and even a couple plot holes in Disney Star Wars but this was too much for even me to handle. Like why is a Jedi in meditation for ten years suddenly decide to take suicidal poison? It just isn't very Jedi-ish. Why was I tricked on ads that Carrie-Anne Moss would be in this when she has like a five minute cameo - and she's fantastic during her on-screen time which is even more annoying. Why can you escape from a bunch of Jedis now by just stirring up some dust?It's just lazy writing and bad acting hidden behind some flashy CGI, par for the course with Disney Star Wars. I really wanted to like this and I'm super flexible on canon, I just want good storytelling. I'll admit Kathleen Kennedy has a couple wins with the first two seasons of Mando, Andor, and Rogue One but overall her track record is a train wreck. She needs to go (and I know Bob Iger is too scared to make that decision).Two stars for Lee Jung-jae who I think has some solid Jedi presence and does the best he can with the toilet script.Disclaimer this was only through episode 3 which is as far as I can handle.

The series seems to struggle with balancing its narrative, leaning heavily into contemporary issues rather than exploring the rich lore and imaginative storytelling that originally captivated fans.Ironically, a fan film titled ""The Acolyte,"" released three years ago, demonstrates a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Star Wars universe despite its low-budget production. This fan-made project captures the essence of what Star Wars should be-immersive, character-driven, and steeped in the mystical elements that made the franchise iconic.Kathleen Kennedy's empire may have the resources, but it often misses the mark on delivering the soul of Star Wars.

They have bland dialogue, nonsensical plot points and questionable decisions regarding the lore.

But worst of all, it plays out like a high school theater production and leaves the audience feeling second hand embarrassment. It would be one thing if it was flexible with lore in other to tell a complex story. But instead, it's just a lame, on-the-nose sex allegory.

They try attempts at make profound statements which come off extremely corny and obvious.There is basically no characters development whatsoever. Even their faces and hairstyles remain unchanged between childhood and adulthood.The logic in this show is just absurd. The amount of times where they make some kind of declaration and then turn around and defy what was just defined as the rules of the world makes no sense. For example the poison... they claimed they couldn't directly harm the Jedi because his shield was too strong so they needed a way to get to him without entering his shield. One would think maybe some type of projectile or magic to weaken the shield or some shrewed scheme or something right? Nope, she makes a vial of poison and just hands it to him to drink and he just agrees to drink it....what?

" The Disappointing ""The Acolyte""
",2024-06-21,"""The Acolyte"" is a significant disappointment for long-time Star Wars fans. The series strays far from the core elements that made the franchise beloved. The writing is lackluster, with dialogue that feels wooden and forced, making it difficult to connect with the characters. The plot is equally weak, failing to engage or excite. While the special effects are commendable, they cannot compensate for the poor narrative and character development.The creators' defensive attitude towards criticism is frustrating. Blaming fans for negative reviews instead of acknowledging the show's flaws shows a lack of respect for the audience. This attitude only exacerbates the disappointment, as fans' legitimate concerns are dismissed as mere resistance to change.The series also suffers from a misuse of its budget. Despite its high production cost, the show feels cheaply made, reminiscent of low-budget 80s sci-fi rather than a premium Star Wars production. The performances are largely subpar, with only a few exceptions. This is disappointing, given the talented cast involved.Overall, ""The Acolyte"" is a missed opportunity. It fails to honour the Star Wars legacy and alienates its fanbase through both its poor execution and the creators' dismissive attitude towards constructive criticism.

No Jedi accompany her.Later on we find that nobody believes she could have done it, however she must as there is no other explanation.Well apart from the fact she apparently has a twin sister...I guess twin sisters are in the blood for Star Wars, but they were painted into a corner for Return Of The Jedi as part of the trilogy to do a twist.When creating a new story from fresh if feels like they have relied on one of the weakest of plot devices.",3.0
" So unfair rating
",2024-06-25,"I don't really understand why most reviewers see this show as such a failure getting these low ratings, it seems like it is a social media trend to take it out on Disney!! Did fans just forget the recent trail of great saga-storytelling shows from Andor to Obi-Wan to Bad Batch to Ahsoka?! Even the entertaining ones like Mandalorian or Boba Fett?! Then let's talk about this show! Finally we see a serious non-anime show taking us to the history before phantom menace, to the routes where all this started, to a time where Jedi were so common, abundant and in full capacity and power. Perhaps with the story unfolding we will see some seeds or cracks in the fabric of the republic that should lead to the subsequent tyranny of the Sith. To the contrary of many other reviews I actually like the idea that there are multiple interpretations of the force at that time. I can understand that more factions had access to the force and with time some of those groups demised along with their interpretations while only the Jedi one survived till around last days of the republic, the time where even Jedi will begin to go downhill. The actors are not bad as well. Haven't seen any lousy or any too theatrical nonsense performance. Take it easy guys and indulge in the world of ancient star-wars.",10.0

The setting and the premise could have work with more effort put into it, better writing and better edit but it's simply not there. It looks like a rough draft of scenes that hasn't been worked through properly. Maybe older series and movies where made by people who knew the amount of effort required to make something good, made it's something plaguing the writers generation. Writers and directors are picked for what they stands for rather than what they actually bring to the table when it comes to making a good show. Making a good show requires dedication.

Therefore, this has less to do with the Acolyte and more to do with the fact that there is a large contingency of adults that haven't grown up and believe a program always meant for children should, somehow and for no good reason, cater to them instead.

Is it so improbable that inexperienced Jedi don't really speak like their seniors? Because that never happens in a real world scenarios.

I would recommend for any production to take as an example the quality of the animated project ""Clone Wars"" - which is definitely the standard of quality in the plot outline of Star Wars mythology. I think most connoisseurs of the Far-Pre-Far Galaxy have long dreamed of seeing with their own eyes the rise of the Republic, but not in this way, not in this way, and not about this, which appeared before our eyes in the Acolyte series.

For much less Anakin, Ahsoka, and Luke were scold about their lack of knowledge and experience.Jecki Lon you'd figure she's the actual Knight seeing she acts as if she is, when she's just a Padawan. And none of the actual masters put them in their place.As for dear Amandla Stenberg, she would actually be a good addition if her characters were worth anything.On one side you got a character that's overreaching, bland and sometimes cringe.

The opening fight scene used more of a slow motion Kung-fu fight style where the actors gracefully slide and take strange leaps all over that seem too exaggerated for a Jedi at times. That's just not Star Wars. All the Jedi dress the same and they act more like weird monks, so how did that turn into the Star Wars that we know 100 years later.

It's either the fault of the casting team or the screenplay writers. It's just not engaging enough. I got bored after watching 10 minutes of the first episode and had to force myself to finish it. Now I'm not sure I want to start watching the second episode.To watch all these actors playing as jedi characters without any charisma is truly painful. The jedis were less charismatic and less engaging than Jar Jar Binks. Don't waste your time with this one.,2.0
" Pandaverse expanded.
",2024-06-23,"I'm not mad or surprised by how bad this show is. Once you accept you are not the intended audience and enjoy the train wreck as it unfolds it can be quite the unintentional comedy. Andor, Rogue One, and the early seasons of The Mandalorian.this is not. For comparison Book of Boba Fett was much better. The show may redeem itself in the following episodes before the finale but I doubt it. I grew up on Star Wars and I have many complaints about the prequel trilogy. Considering the amount of money poured into this show why did no one proof read the script. I do enjoy the Kung Fu fight scenes but couldn't a Jedi just blast you with a wall of air or something? You can't beat someone up if you can't touch them. I really hope the bad guys win in this show. The good guys are just that dumb, trust me.",2.0
" Mediocre story telling...
",2024-06-19,"SW directors should know SWs! This is a dumpster fire that instead of telling a story (even if its bad) it is just lecturing us...
K Kennedy, the director and everyone who has participated in this, should be fired and never again hired by Disney.It is like Disney hates people and wants its fans (the ones who spend money) to stop watching them.Four episodes of NOTHING, how did this was green lit is beyond me, and how after all of the Marvel flops, they keep making this us beyond comprehension.This is just a soapbox for the ""director / creator"" who belongs in a coffee shop ruining peoples breakfast.",2.0
" This is not Star Wars
",2024-06-13,"I'm really sorry to say that this is not good at all.First of all, the creators don't understand the force.It feels like they never understood the Star Wars at all.The story is weak.Acting is ok but it doesn't feels for real.More like theatre or staged in front of a giant green screen.This could work for some five year old kids that never seen Star Wars before...but I doubt it.I really tried to like this as a Star Wars fan.But it is really painful to see how Disney ruined the Star Wars franchise with this.Totally waste of time and money.You really got to have some kind of talent to be able to make such a bad version of Star Wars.It almost feels like they made it bad on purpose.So save your time and read an old newspaper instead.You will have more fun with that.",1.0
" A mistake that should have never been created
",2024-06-20,"This show was not made with fans or anyone who enjoys star wars in mind. The new development of ""the force"" does not match up with anything the movies or prior shows have made cannon.The creator and actors said they made this movie with the idea in mind to tick off star wars fan and they succeeded. This is by far the worst star wars project I have ever seen even worst than the rise of Skywalker, which I never thought was possible. Hopefully after this flop of a mistake disney will realize they have to take a little more time developing a thought provoking show, rather than throwing millions at a project and assuming it'll work because of the 2 billion dollar franchise they bought.",1.0
" The reviews don't do this show justice...
",2024-06-15,"I watched Rebels and The Clone Wars, there are a bunch of ideas that are borrowed from those two shows but made in live-action in this. There's simply nothing here that seem like the creators just winged it. Sure there's some cringey dialogue, but that stuff is an established thing in any and all Star Wars show/movie.What I like about the show is that it's not relying on the volume as much as The Mandalorian or Boba Fett. The sets look really good, the costumes look really good as well. The characters, while I was disappointed some didn't make it too far, are good. One standout, however, is Jung-Jae Lee. He really stands out from the rest of the cast, even though Amandla Stenberg is doing a great job as well.The visuals are really good, though I do wish they did better with the cinematography a lot of it feel very static and not very engaging. The cinematography during fight scenes in the first and second episode are pretty good though.What I think is happening with the reviews of this show is based on misinformation, a one-sided race war (where the ""attacked"" have made up their own war in their heads and they're now fighting a brick wall), or males that are just afraid of women behind the wheel, who knows.Sure, there are flaws of the show, but it's simply not as bad as a 4.6 rating.As someone who has watched every Star Wars show (live action and animated) as well as the movies, this is Star Wars. People here are overexagerating and blowing a whole lot of nothing out of proportion, to the point where it's an obsession. I highly recommend the show.",8.0
" It's good, not great, but I'm hopeful.
",2024-06-12,"It's not great, but it's definitely Star Wars. This tale is set 100 years before all those events we all know. And it's refreshingly different (which is ticking off a lot of purists). There are things to love here: different types of Force users, different species, kung fu, a mystery to solve. There are things to hate here: Star Wars physics (a fire extinguisher in space?), Star Wars fan services (""bad feelings"" ugh), and Star Wars-grade acting (*sigh*). The core of this is oddly VERY Star Wars: it's a cheesy, space opera fantasy roller coaster concerned with cool action, cinematic set pieces and feel-good YA emotional underdrama than SCIENCE and canon-building. The question Star Wars asks is, ""did you have fun?"". The answer after watching three episodes is a resounding ""yes"". Was it the BEST ride? No. But it was and is cool and it was and is DIFFERENT. For that alone I give applause.Solid 7 thus far. Totally watchable for folks who have gone too long in the SW ""safe zone"" but not quite edgy or tight enough to be thoroughly satisfying. Fact is, most of the SW universe stuff is worse than this so I'm having fun and looking forward to the rest of the episodes.",7.0
" The direction of Star Wars is unfortunately negative
",2024-06-20,"I went into this show with an open mind as I do with all the Star Wars shows and waited until I watched 4 episodes until reviewing. The show manages to throw in a lot of content that seems unnecessary but what garners my poor review is that in spite of having a show in the golden age of the Jedi, and a semblance of some plot, the show is entirely uninteresting. There is a vast amount of things you could do in time frames outside the films, especially before the prequels. And they managed to come up with a story that is so uninteresting I was looking at the time left on every episode. It's boring.",1.0

You seem confused about what kind of movie you wanna show ...,2.0
" Boring
",2024-06-19,"Uninspired performances and lackluster writing fail to evoke any emotional connection, making the characters as forgettable as the storyline.The plot is a mess. Viewers are treated to a series of events that lack any real sense or purpose. The series portray the Jedi as inept, authoritarian aligned with current ideologies falls flat, mocking the franchise's lore rather than offering meaningful commentary. Anakin's significance is undermined in a move that seems more designed to attract media praise than serve the story.One of the most glaring issues is the series pacing. Scenes drag on far longer than necessary. Moments that should be tense or emotional fall flat due to lackluster writing and poor,wooden performances.",1.0
" Bad writing, even worse acting
",2024-06-19,"I can't believe how bad the acting is. When one of the main actors was supposed to be angry, my wife said as she was just passing through the room, ""She doesn't seem like she's mad."" When it's that obvious to someone who has watched 10 seconds of the show, you know it's got to be bad. The one bright spot is Lee Jung-jae: it's shocking how well he delivers such bad dialogue.Special effects are ok, but in episode 4, there is a ship landing on the tree-filled planet, and it looks so fake, like CGI from 15 years ago.Also, the characters lack chemistry. People who are supposed to know each other barely seem like they have a natural connection. Again, the bad acting doesn't help.I'll probably keep watching, cuz I'm a sucker for anything Star Wars, but I'm not hopeful that it's going to get any better.",3.0
" What was that?
",2024-06-14,"This show has to be the worst mash of malarkey ever conceived. It possesses all of the current day bile flowing from television and film. It seems the research done for this series, based on SW lore was ZERO. The Jedi (males in particular) seem to be a twisted group of idiots plodding along with no sense of identity. They are only there only to show how superior the female gender is. The writers and creators are more obsessed with making a statement than telling a coherent story. As far as the characters, they are all bland and I, for one, could care less if they were punctured by a light sabre, or disintegrated by Boba Fett. Come to think of it, that might be a more interesting story. I gave it a 3 simply because the special effects are pretty good. My advise, can the writing staff, and call Filoni.",3.0
" I don't mind the DEI stuff everyone's talking about...
",2024-06-14,But the writing just feels like an old teen show aimed at young teens. It feels lazy and just not Star Wars.This maybe feels like a mediocre show someone came up with and executives thought it would flop by itself so put it in the star wars universe in hopes in would gain traction.A good story and characters should be good enough to gain interest without needing to tie it into a big franchise. I hope future productions keep that in mind and stop exploiting the fantastic star wars legacy with anything they have left on the cutting room floor.I don't care about efforts to make something more inclusive if the show is just poor. Make something super inclusive but make sure it's a great show and people will watch regardless.Poor effort.,2.0
" Disney running this show into the ground
",2024-06-07,"I will always have a fond love for SW, prequels and original trilogy. But Disney has had one. ONE. Good Star Wars project (rogue one) and everything else has just been mediocre fan pleasing and now this. Even the last Jedi made up for poor story telling with some exciting moments. This is emotionless, awful, please Disney sell Star Wars or do something because this is not it. I yearn for the days of true emotion, true battles, character development. SW is silly now. I understand it's always been part of it but now it seems like the focus. I don't know if I'll ever love SW like I once did but I will try.",1.0
" Dramatic dementia and staged stupidity
",2024-06-12,"I rated the first two episodes, in which we were shown fire in space, neutrally and with restraint, but the third series was released, and in this series the creators pile up so much unpretentious nonsense that reflects the creative decline and propaganda surrealism of binary categories and objectifications, typical biopolitics and identity spectra, which are not something to understand, but to contemplate and listen to is disgusting. The boundaries between good and evil, it turns out, do not exist. The Jedi are not so right, and evil is a necessary counterweight, and it's not even that the Jedi can be wrong, but in the very context of the statement, in which you yourself determine what is right and wrong for you, but even here there are no clear boundaries - everything is allowed, if not forbidden.Let's remember what Master Yoda said in George Lucas's first film: ""Fear the dark force. Anger, fear, aggression - the dark side of the force is this. They come easily, give support in battle. Once you enter the dark path, it will determine your fate forever, it will consume you...""
But it doesn't matter to the ""mouse top managers"", they have their own licensed universe, protected by purchased authorship, and they are the masters in it, and they do whatever they want.The third series is just the apogee of dramatic mediocrity. Religion, shamanism, magic, matriarchal society, the threads of the universe - everything is mixed up, everything is upside down - ""what are they carrying"" - I would like to ask them such a question.Space Amazons who call themselves witches, raise twin girls for some kind of mission, wave their hands with a serious face - conjure, recite spells - what is going on here at all?The Jedi appear and demand that the girls pass the test. And it's kind of voluntary, but forced - what kind of nonsense is this?A little twin sister, with an impulsive behavior disorder, is doing some kind of ""game"". Leslie Hadland presents a little sociopathic rebel from her inflamed mind and masks all this nonsense with fantastic decorations, just to justify the development of an absurd conflict. Who came up with all this? What for? For what?I would like to ask the screenwriters a question: ""Have you been checked by a psychiatrist for a long time? Should you go for a checkup?""In my first review of this series, I was more supportive, and said: ""But there are fears that the absurdity of actions will gain momentum - this usually happens after episode 2, but let's hope for the best.""
My fears have been confirmed, the absurdity is simply off the scale. Now I understand why Kerri-Anne Moss chose a cameo role, and she did the right thing!And all these plot absurdities of the first two episodes: with fire in space, with frost that does not freeze, with suicide Jedi - this is only the visible part of all this ""gibberish"" that is in the head of the screenwriter.The series saves not only on special effects, but also on common sense and artistic creativity. I have not seen such scenic mediocrity and staged stupidity for a long time.In my opinion, this film show should be closed on the third episode, so that it is simple, banal not to disgrace itself in the eyes of the audience and not discredit the studio.",2.0
" The OG Movies Were Hated Too

I encourage you to approach it with an open mind and judge it on its own merits.The storyline is a welcome departure from the usual narratives we've grown accustomed to.So, dismiss any preconceived notions and dive into the series with curiosity.

It lacks complexity, depth and is straight up amateur.All of the retcons are exacerbated by terrible directing and writing. It's amusing, Disney shareholders voted to keep the same personnel in charge despite the internal metrics not being so hot. Perhaps, Disney hasn't learned their lesson.That said, I don't think Star Wars can be saved unless a reorg of all upper management is done OR George Lucas rebuys the rights.",1.0

The opening dialogue and acting was so bad and cringe it felt like I was watching a YouTube fan film.They need better/more experienced actors for this kind of content. Star Wars is supposed to be a AAA brand so why do they bother to bring out the C tier squad for these shows. Proper actors, with proper direction could make a big difference here.Unfortunately they aren't to blame, ultimately the fault is Disneys top level leadership.

Well the woman died anyway in the first episode so now we see a flashback of their story that last the whole episode.Some hints are that their in vitro mothers are not far from the story of Darth Plagueis the wise. Ohh yes, between chanting and using the Force to push each others with ridiculous gestures, the surrogate mother reveals she carried the girls in a Mexican telenovela style...There is also a disgusting display of Jedi forcing their ways into families to get Force sensitive children.I tell you, Anakin would have my entire approval to wipe out this insane cult cause Jedi order or council is too much to say.Horrible writing, casting and story. Why would you do this with such good background coming from the old republic?Jedi are dressed like fairies with white capes ironed and the lightsaber is touched, ignited and shown every possible minute.., The Sith guy also ignites his lightsaber for no reason at all.It's by far the most ridiculous and useless story I have ever seen.",1.0
" Another Happy Landing
",2024-06-07,"The Acolyte starts as strong as only a modern era Star Wars can. Dead pan line reading opens into a fight scene, which while looking cool, feels off in the Star Wars franchise and it is almost as if it used to be part of another. The plot then unfolds into a compelling murder mystery that reveals who the killer is and who isn't in the first 10 minutes. Holmes and Poirot better take notes!After that the show puts science back into science fiction with a rare treat of some fire in outer space. This masterpiece scene is followed by some more line reading, exposition dumps and a plethora of contradicting lines and statements. As expected the pace considerably slows down from the opening minutes.All in all the pilot (twin) episode of The Acolyte barely takes off before crashing head on into the ground but it is fine. Everyone's mediocre fanfiction gets a 180 million show, everyone's wife gets hired and the fans as per tradition were branded as bigots before the show even aired.Another happy landing for Disney Star Wars.",3.0
" Disappointing Journey to the High Republic
",2024-06-12,"I waited for episode 3 to review this, to give it a proper chance, and unfortunately things only got worse. A blundering story that feels like a fanfiction, this largely flashback episode, episode three tacks lore into the world that doesn't really feel like it fits - even moreso than the previous additions where no effort was made to weave the ideas into the setting cohesively.While boasting good cinematography, makeup, costumes, and occasionally impressive special effects, this Star Wars series suffers from numerous issues that undermine its overall quality. The pacing is uneven, rushing through the setup and then slowing to a crawl with an extended flashback episode. Many of the action sequences feel choppy with too many cuts.The acting is largely mediocre, with most performances coming across as either phoned-in or overacted. A major bright spot is Lee Jung-jae as a compelling Jedi master who outshines the rest of the cast. However, the dialogue he and others have to deliver is often corny.Beyond the acting, there are jarring inconsistencies in the lore, action, and plot that pull you out of the experience. The attempt to reimagine the Force and Jedi as more martial artists than monastic guardians strips away some of the mystery. Additions like ""witches"" feel tonally inconsistent with the established Star Wars universe.While ambitious in trying to depict the High Republic era, the series lacks a clear creative vision. Rather than deepening the lore, it often comes across like a kitchen sink fantasy or fan fiction disconnected from the core themes, lore and tone of Star Wars as a setting. With some more experienced actors, tighter writing, and a firmer grasp of worldbuilding, it could have lived up to its potential. As is, it ends up feeling like a B-grade 80s/90s TV series or even a stage play rather than being actually immersive.",4.0
" The Epitaph
",2024-06-15,"It's well known that Disney is digging its own grave with their version of Star Wars, but by hiring a sci-fi-wise inexperienced director, Leslye Headland, they stubbornly and definitively decided to burn all bridges and drive off the cliff into the 'what rhymes with Snoke?' abyss.So here it is: a clunky, badly directed, bland snoozer that couldn't be a clearer sign not to tune in ever again. I'm not heavily into the Star Wars canon (you can check better sources on YouTube for that) - I grew up with the Original Trilogy in my pre-teen years, and I'm lucky for that as they will never be able to take that joy away from me with this underachieving crap.Watch it for laughs or steer clear, it doesn't matter much.",3.0

It plays like a fan film of Star Wars than an actual Star Wars show. I loved what Disney did with shows like Obi Wan, The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett, but The Acolyte falls short of being worthy of the name Star Wars. The show seems more concerned with showing diversity than giving us a good story with good dialogue. What good are diverse characters if they are made to look stupid? This was really a letdown for me being a life long Star Wars fan. This is not the way.",1.0
" This is not the Star Wars, you're looking for...
",2024-06-08,"THE UPSIDE
1. The first production in the series to finally break away from the Skywalker family plot line. Of course, you can argue whether it couldn't have been done better (after two episodes, I don't feel like I've watched an outstanding thing).2. It may not be an overly exciting and very suspenseful intrigue, but I appreciate the creators' attempts for bringing in different plot matrices in the Star Wars set design.3. The show looks good from the visual point of view, which is probably no surprise when the budget of the series is set around $180 million. If I had to pick on something, it would certainly be that I didn't really see the money in the first two episodes (and for a 40-minute episode it costs $20 million).4. If you are a fan of the High Republic, you will probably like The Acolyte, as it may turn out to be a successful transfer of High Republic to a live-action series - as well as a relatively successful bridge leading to the prequel trilogy. Time will tell!THE DOWNSIDE
1. Disney still doesn't focus on giving viewers more main characters who are not human. Since the dawn of time, all the central characters in Star Wars, whether on the Jedi or Sith side, have been humans. Are Chewbacca and Jar Jar Binks really the pinnacles of what Hollywood and Disney are capable of?2. Be prepared to come to terms with the wasted potential of a capable and gifted actress. Known for her role as Trinity in The Matrix, Carrie-Ann Moss plays Indara, a powerful Jedi master. If you expected her role and character to be developed in any way, you are in for a bitter disappointment. We meet Indara in the first minutes of the series, but only to see her die in a duel with Mae. What's more, she fights using Force-Fu, which is something like Kung-Fu, only with the use of the Force. The scene of her duel is a shameless copy of the fistfight scenes from The Matrix. Several fragments of it are almost identical to those in which Neo participated. The creators probably don't even hide that this was their goal.(I am completely unable to understand it and I don't like it at all. And above all, it's a shame that Indara dies at the beginning of the series, although Disney+ promotes the series with her, wherever it can.)3. If you're not a fan of the High Republic, you will dislike the Acolyte even more as it refers to the era visually - for example, through the white and gold outfits of the Jedi knights or the hipster hairstyles of some of them. If this is not your cup of tea, The Acolyte will not convince you in any way. Personally, the hairstyles don't suit me at all, and the white and gold Jedi robes look kitschy and extremely cheap and tacky. I also don't buy into any of Disney's attempts to introduce bizarre ""novelties"" and ""improvements"" to the Jedi mythology. Speaking of which...4. There weren't too many changes in the first two episodes, but Force-Fu itself, for me, swings on the border of what makes sense in Jedi mythology and what is a cheesy visual trick to attract young audiences to this series.Star Wars is not a series about murder or about roundhouse kicks - samurai films are in its DNA - not productions à la Bruce Lee. In my opinion, the latter types of ideas are somewhere between the desire to expand the universe and its incomprehension. I suspect that the creators swing closer to the ignorance bit.5. The cast is not convincing enough. The main character seems to be the only bright spot in the casting, while the rest of the actors appear 'wooden' ((Lee Jung-jae)), flimsy (Dafne Keen), or completely disconnected from this universe (Charlie Barnett). (I admire and give credit to Lee Jung-jae for learning English for this series, although sadly, it's still not enough to make me watch his performance with bated breath.)For example, Carrie-Ann Moss - introduced in the first minutes of the series - is probably even more stiff and heartless than when she played Trinity in The Matrix. She tries to portray the stoicism and seriousness of a Jedi master in such a way that she looks more like a robot from a 60s (or 70s) production of Dr. Who.Furthermore, the fact that she appeared in this series, just to fight for two minutes in the style of The Matrix and that's it, felt quite exasperating if not downright embarrassing. Well, unless the creators have plans to somehow bring her back to life, but even so - I can see how that could only make the situation worse. I also don't really see any character in this series capable of amassing a cult following among Star Wars fans.BOTTOM LINE: Some things worked for the series - and others, didn't. It's up to you to figure out whether you find The Acolyte worthy of your time. May the Force be with You, on that one!",4.0
" A good start
",2024-06-08,"I honestly had no hopes for this series. But the 2 episodes that i've seen so far has been pretty good.I like too see how the jedi's were before the war, and how they often choose to fight without violence, exept for Yord who is a bit too triggerhappy with his saber. But its still understandeble, i mean look at anakin, he had his saber out 95%of the time. We have never really seen the jedi's in a peaceful era, exept for the phatom menace. So it was fun to experience that.I also really like their clothing, for both the jedi and mae. Mae's feel inspirated by culture which is not a shock based on thet shes from one of the 3.2 mil worlds. So just stop seeing it as forced culture and see it as it, is a big a$$ universe will have different cultures and clothing.Im not the biggest fan of the evil twin plot. It kinda feels like that part was was written by a child. But i will give it a chance and im exited to see what they will do with it.I mean its only been 2 episodes so far and i actually think it keeps a high quality. I like it more so far then i liked Boba or ahsoka, maybe even Obiwan at this point.It feelt less forced. Like they could make up a new story this time. While the focus on the others was to continue something that had already ended. And to throw in as many cameos as possible.So while it might not be perfect i really think everybody should at least give it a chance and watch it.

After watching the first two episodes, I cannot differentiate if I'm watching something from a long time ago in a galaxy far away or a facsimile of the art of Shaolin discipline.

In addition to the forced dialogues, the most terrible thing is that simply since Disney has Star Wars in their hands, they kill the old stories and destroy the well-constructed, defining characters and write the worst possible stories or rewrite an old one, thereby discrediting themselves, because the original stories are much more colorful, imaginative and richer. If that's all Disney is going for, I'll stick with the books. This series is not for me anymore.",1.0

Jedi are (once again) being watered down in order to carry a 'Jedi BAD' narrative. The problem with that narrative is that it makes no sense and does not fit in the existing story line.Fight choreography is slow and hilariously bad on top of it: Slow, telegraphed fights that seem minted out of early 2000's bad TV. Seriously, there are better fight scenes in old Kevin Sorbo camp shows than this one.The entire universe's logic has been thrown onto its head for the sole reason of pushing impossibly boring characters. Even in the first episode, the series instantly suffers from Game of Thrones-style season 6-8 'impossibly instant travel' syndrome mixed with a side-infection of 'terribly bad character logic'.Even if you turn your brain off and try to enjoy the views and CGI, it's just stale and boring.",1.0

It was a story of hope of good coming together to overcome a huge evil. How quiet and calm strength with dignity and integrity was something to aspire to be. How anyone could be more. A show that inspired all because it was not created for just one piece of society but for everyone. I miss that Star Wars.

The main character falling back when she was with the Jedi and therefore finding the dead Jedi doesn't make sense as the other Jedi should also have sensed something.

I don't mean to be a crank, but it just seems like when SW revolves around the Jedi Sith thing, SW gets boring. Partly this comes down to taste, but my personal taste is that good writing, directing, editing, scoring, wardrobe, and VFX beats kung fu and lightsabers any day. This is SW YA, and it isn't even good YA fiction. I will finish the series because that's how I roll, but I won't be surprised if I end up disliking this as much as Ahsoka or BOBF.

I do hope this changes with the story progressing as she has so much potential as a character, but also as an actress that they are not leveraging.With there era we also get a glimpse of a new fighting style 'Force Fu' which I have some mixed feeling on. The shots look cool and it can 100% exist within the universe, but how it's executed in the show comes off like a 2000 action movie, pulling you out of the emersion in Stars Wars uni.

The acting, writing, cinematography, and directing was amateurish. I've seen B movies with better storylines and acting. I was actually embarrassed for the actors in it, though they deserve it for taking part in this cruddy show. The chanting scene of the witches is the definition of cringe. I can already tell they are trying to make the Jedi the villains of the series and the witches are the misunderstood heros. Any real Star Wars fan knows the Jedi would have no interest in the twins given their age, they are too old to train! It was the main reason the Jedi council didn't want Anakin to be trained. From the first opening scene in the series, this episode no sense. The dialogue continuously contradicts the actions of the characters. ""Kill without using a weapon"" continues to kill with a weapon. ""We do not use the force for violence"" continues to use force for violence. A Jedi handing his light saber without question a to child. Like here child go play with this extremely dangerous weapon. Wtf?!? Who wrote this garbage!This series is a perfect example of what happens when you hire based off DEI ideology and not off experience and merit. You end up with a studio full of untalented narcissistic activist who only care about pushing their agenda while inserting themselves into every aspect of a series or film. These people do not care if the house burns down in the process. Worst part is, if their creation is not accepted by the fanbase,they vilify them with insults because in their minds if you reject their creation, you are rejecting them.

It is genuinely franchise destroying on par with 'Terminator: Dark Fate', 'Dr Who: The Timeless Children' or 'Highlander: The Source' in that it fundamentally fails to understand what made the series popular in the first place. Which is to say nothing about the genuine disregard for established canon and world building.It's the kind of bad that I'm not mad anymore, or even disappointed, because that would have required me to still care. If this is the future of Star Wars then I'm done, I am no longer interested what they are trying to sell me.

The writing, including dialogue is very, very poor.The execution is not much better (but one can argue the actors have to work with what they get).I'm not even talking about lore/canon breaking or not.

" HOW did they muck this up?!?
",2024-06-09,"Star Wars. It sells itself. Be true to the OG movies and give a nodding acquaintance to all the sequels/prequals as appropriate. Throw in some ILM level SFX, get a top whack writer and director, hire a couple of well known and a lot of up and coming actors, sprinkle some special 'force' sauce, simmer to build excitement and then release.Two episodes in, the only person capable of acting is CA Moss. Everyone else, and everything thing else feels like it's done by kids on work experience?Wooden 'acting', average (by the high standards set previously) SFX and thus far a really boring plot.

This suffers from the same stale writing as every other Star Wars show accept Andor, and even that is extremely slow.

" So bad it made me create this account to write a review
",2024-06-25,"The writing is simply horrible. Ignoring the fact that the writing breaks cannon multiple times and undermines Anakin's lore/story, it is also incredibily insulting to viewers intelligence.Things that simply dont make sense/ are horrible:
1) The first fight makes no sense. A jedi did not stand to protect the peace when Mae walks up and says she will murder the jedi and harm her friends in the process. Yet the jedi dismisses this clear threat and doesnt begin to fight until all her friends and others in the bar are severely injured (she was sitting 2 feet away). Whats even worse is that the jedi died to a knife near instantly while in the show Ahsoka, Sabine was stabbed with a lightsaber and lived to see a full recovery shortly after. Disney needs to figure out a consistent gauge of weapon leathality (RIP Qui Gon).2) Mae attempts to murder her sister. In doing so she sets a base made out of STONE on fire which miraculously was able to wipe out a whole covenent of force trained witches.3) Said stone base/fortress is supposed to be secret yet it is so large that it takes up more space than the giant mountain it was built in the side of.4) The implication that the jedi were part of killing the covenent in order to take back Mae and the other kid (whose name that I cannot remember) back to the Jedi temple is nonsensical. Even if they ablsolutely needed to bring the kids back there was no need to fight or kill for it as the Kid-2 (my new name for this forgettable character) had already willing offered to leave with the Jedi.5) When the jedi had first arrived at the witches base, the mother witch used the force to enter torbins mind and control pain/ cause him pain. This takes place like two scenes after the same mother witch explains that none of the witches (even herself) should use the force as a weapon.6) The ending scene of the first episode that previews the main villain (Kylo Smiley) includes a moment of them igniting their red lightsaber for no reason. It was litteraly done only as a wow factor even though there was no need for the villain to ignite it. Its always better to show and not tell yet the only thing the show knows how to do is tell the viewers everything in a Dora-esque kinda way.7) The second jedi that Mae went to kill wouldnt allow himself out of the force field to die when Mae was trying to kill him with a knife but suddenly surrenders a day later because Mae leaves poisen in front of him??8) Wookie jedi, cool! Nah, he was on screen to get your hopes up but they dont even have the decency to give us a fight scene prior to his death. He dies off screen and not much more (if anything) is built on his story.9) ""The power of one! The power of two! The power of many!"" I dont even know what else to say about this besides that I cringed so hard I had to turn off the show and start it again the next day.This is stuff only from the first two episodes I believe.

Having watched the currently released 4 episodes via a friend, I couldn't be happier that I'm at least not financially supporting this debacle. There is seriously not a single redeeming point about this show. The acting is awful, the plot doesn't make any sense. After 4 episodes I can't remember a single moment of the music standing out. The writing is childishly stupid and the instant you turn on your brain you'll find plot wholes everywhere. To not even speak about the uncountable ways they break the lore... The twin's dialogue is totally unbelievable and fake and they're not the only ones with this issue. In one scene, one of the twins goes from not wanting the other to leave to stone cold threatening to kill her if she tries to leave. Then she instantly proceeds to lock her in the room and try to burn her alive. Within literally 5 seconds, Like What???? The Jedi behave like idiots and are portrayed as the bad guys. However nothing matters Disney probably thought, we'll just throw in a cameo for the member berries that has and will satisfy the audience. However the ""cameo"" they throw in is Ki-Adi Mundi who canonically isn't even born yet. The series takes place around 135 BBY and Ki-Adi is born in 93 BBY, that is a 40 year gap!

" Maybe not the worst Star Wars' series, but right down there
",2024-06-06,"Watched the first episode and was not impressed by the acting at all. Of course, we expect a ""girl power"" theme, but it's taken to the extreme right off the bat as our villain quickly dispatches all the males in the cantina, leaving only a female ""Jedi"" to put up a fight. They have a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon duel that ends badly for more of them when the other makes her fall for the oldest distraction trick in the book.Action sequences aren't awful, but that's hardly high praise. Not until at least halfway through do we meet a straight, white, male character, and he's a baddie in prison. It's all girls and/or people/aliens of color through out, none of whom are particularly memorable.The plot is okay, would-be hero wrongly accused, but the execution is not interesting, the characters dull, and the dialogue woodenly written and delivered.

Despite the slow burn from Andor, that show looks beautiful in many ways with great dialogue. Not sure if I'll continue with this show since the setup from the first two episodes was uninspiring and dull.The story could have gone a path that leads to the prequels with Darth Plagues(Palpatine's Master).

Obviously no one was willing to step forward and speak up about how bad this is. The look and feel is just so different than any other Star Wars, it feels like a show directed by high schoolers. The characters all feel young and immature and not taking anything serious. There's a playfulness to it that just doesn't belong. Pretty much zero character development.

" Has the right feel for Star Wars - Saturday matinee adventure/mystery
",2024-06-08,"The Acolyte (2 episodes in) has the right feel for Star Wars in the sense of a Saturday matinee adventure/mystery. There is a mix of sudden reveals and cliffhanger endings with a sense that one will have to go back and rewatch the series to catch missing hints and details. Like the best Star Wars, there should also be a sense of the mythological or archetypal (as in Joseph Campbell), and there are set ups in the first two episodes that look very promising once you pause to think about them.""Your eyes can deceive you-- don't trust them"" appears early as a major theme, and among the hints for how to decode what you are watching in the plot. Things are not what they seem, and implications will unfold in layers.This is better storytelling than other recent SW content like Ahsoka, which feels more like a lot of ponderous moving of characters around like chess pieces into positions for some future story to be told that we have to wait for (another season, another movie), while throwing in some references to past SW characters and events, like being tossed candy to keep you satiated, but altogether serving no greater purpose, making for a less satisifying story.Even though the production design in The Acolyte looks smaller (no big set pieces or space battles so far), the universe feels bigger, with new aliens, new tech, and new ideas about the Force. The universe should feel big enough to be filled with suprises, even to civilizations that have existed for a long time, like Europeans discovering the Americas (the people, their cultures, and all the new natural life), opening up all sorts of expanded understandings of the world, but also leading to fear and uncertainty and paths of destruction. My prediction is that the more serious parts of upcoming Acolyte episodes will set up those big universe but equally big dark aspects -- we need to see the very early seeds of the megalomaniacal and genocidal aspects of the later galactic Empire. And I think we'll see that emerging in these diverse new characters and their story arcs.",8.0
" A Noncommittal Fart

Episode 4 isn't any better. Four episodes in and it's still a limp plot, flat acting, deflated character building, sets that feel incomplete, zero presence of an actual ominous villain, an incoherently forgettable score, and that's just scratching the surface. Despite the intentional dismantling of Lucas' richly established mythology for the sake of force-feeding an agenda only the myopic producers care about, this show feels like a pre-teen after school special jettisoned from the archives of Goosebumps-meets-Galaxy Quest. Nickelodeon would be proud, but even they would do better. Honestly, Dafne Keen's padawan Jecki Lon might be the only highlight, except she's not given nearly enough to work with, and the rest just leaves us missing Andor.I only continue to watch this dredge because of the potential expansion of some pre-existing character or storyline that I already know from other, ACTUAL Star Wars entries. If it weren't for this fledgling possibility, due to the name ""Star Wars"" being in the title, I would never continue with such poorly conceived boredom.It's not Star Wars.

From the now infamous ""camp fire in space"", to many plotholes/inconsistency in its storyline and with its timeline.The laziness is overwhelming. Many of problems of the show wouldn't be there, had team just used few more minute on it. Example like that ""space fire"", could have just been inside a room that had to manually vent the air from(to stop the fire inside it). I doubt writer didnt know that there would viewers that will complain about it, but writers choose to not care about it. That act its self says alot about this show or the team behind it.This show is still fun to watch, but not because I think this show is worth my time, but the fact is ppl are fighting over it like this ""battle"" that will effect the future of human race or something like that. SW fan or not, politically right or left, or just is the show too political or not...I really enjoying watching this fight more the show, as the show, overall is unfortunately of a very poor quality.Fight are very lazy and choreography are just bad, even for a tvshow.-Dialog never been strong side of SW, but I cant get pass so many corny lines that seem to be written by someone that is doing on purpose for B-movie.Main storyline is ok, but like I said before, it have way too many plotholes(especially for so few episodes aired), as there are weirdly alot of inconsistency in its storyline and with its timeline.While not sure how much CGI cost nowdays, but 180m as budget for 8 episode seem very high.

" A Disastrous Journey to the Dark Side of Star Wars
",2024-06-20,"Disney's ""The Acolyte"" is a masterclass in how to destroy one of the most beloved fictional universes ever created. Despite a hefty budget of $180 million for the first season, the result is a catastrophic mess that leaves fans questioning how such a high-profile project could go so terribly wrong. Leslye Headland, the supposed visionary behind this travesty, must bear the brunt of the blame. The writing is abysmal, riddled with illogical plot points and cringe-worthy dialogue. Characters make such ignorant decisions that it's impossible to take any of them seriously. The attempt to force an ideological agenda is painfully transparent, overshadowing any semblance of storytelling. The direction is equally horrific. The episodes feel rushed and amateurish, reminiscent of a cheap 80s sci-fi show rather than a high-budget Star Wars series. Special effects alone cannot save this sinking ship. Even Lee Jung-jae, who stands out among a sea of stiff and poor acting, cannot salvage the disaster that is this show's cast. Iconic elements of the Star Wars universe are carelessly discarded. The aesthetic, the grit, and the engaging storytelling that once defined the franchise are replaced by shiny, hollow visuals. The characters, stripped of any depth, bumble through the plot with less intelligence than midichlorians. One particularly laughable moment involves Jedi being outwitted by a simple smoke bomb, a scene so poorly executed that it epitomizes the show's incompetence. The lack of respect for the lore and the audience is palpable, making each episode more painful to watch than the last. In conclusion, ""The Acolyte"" is a catastrophic failure on every level. From Leslye Headland's dreadful writing and direction to the incoherent plot and unwatchable acting, this series is an insult to Star Wars fans. Do yourself a favor and avoid this series at all costs. Watching Jar Jar Binks on a loop would be a far more enjoyable use of your time.",1.0

" 180 million budget for cheap thrills and horrible writing
",2024-06-20,"So, I finally got around to watching the first two episodes of The Acolyte, and let me tell you, I was pretty disappointed. Here's the thing: Disney throws all this money at these Star Wars shows, like $180 million for eight episodes for this one, which works out to a whopping $22.5 million per episode! That's a ton of cash, but honestly, it felt more like I was watching a cheesy sci-fi flick from the 80s than a big-budget space adventure. Seriously, Roger Corman could've probably cranked out these episodes back in the day for under a hundred grand each.The whole thing just felt cheap, you know? Like a bad CW show with a low budget and a script written by someone who just phoned it in. The acting wasn't much better either. There were a few bright spots, Lee Jung-jae was definitely the standout, but overall it felt pretty stiff and unconvincing. Again, that might be the fault of bad directing more than anything.But the real kicker for me was the writing. The plot, the dialogue, it was all just terrible. Like, unforgivably bad. Illogical, nonsensical, the kind of stuff that makes you wonder if anyone even read the script before they started filming. How does something like this get approved by Disney? It's beyond me.And hey, I wasn't exactly a fan of Ahsoka to begin with, but this show just made me want to side with the Empire!

Anyway, I think it's the worst series I've ever seen.

",2024-06-12,"Overall this is a weak show. It's not 1/10 weak for me but if we say an average show is 5 or 6 this is certainly significantly behind - hence a 3 from me.And here's why - there are just so many contrived circumstances that make no sense and are there to lazily push the plot forward. Off the top of my head we have:1. Jedi determine that a girl with dreads from a bar looks just like another one (out of potentially millions) and track her down in the middle of space. The fact that she has an obvious alibi doesn't matter - she is arrested anyway. Unfortunately this Jedi can't do the mind read trick that others can I guess.2. The Jedi want her to go back to Coruscant. They are going to Coruscant. They don't take her and instead put her on a separate prisoner ship that is also going to Coruscant. Seems a pretty bad idea to put a potential Jedi assassin on a ship with one guard.3. The prisoners escape and the ship crashes. The prisoners are captured again and taken to Coruscant. No attempt is made to recover any survivors from the crashed ship. So the Jedi go back to where the ship crashed to find her. All of this seems to happen in no time.4. Antagonists assistant (?) takes over a local apothecary, Antagonist then tries to kill Jedi and fails because he is surrounded by a force field. Luckily the assistant has the apothecary and makes a poison that can be used to kill a Jedi but only if he drops his force field. Strange that the only way this plan works is if the Jedi drinks the poison himself - plan A was ""hit him with a knife"" , Plan B is ""hope he drinks some poison"". Also lucky he took over the apothecary in advance but it is unfortunate he didn't come up with the amazing poison plan before she had already tried the first attempt.5. The Jedi bring the hero to go investigate an attempted murder because ""she could be useful"". They chose her rather than any actual Jedi.6. There are no attempts to tighten the security at the Jedi outpost even after the murder attempt by someone who has already killed one jedi. Not sure how they know about the attempt given the jedi master hasn't spoken for a decade - they must have cameras or something. Luckily no-one is checking these cameras when......7. The antagonist does manage to kill the master with the cunning Plan B of ""drink this poison please"". She then slips out through the skylight again. Unfortunately the Jedi party are too late because for some reason they take a long route to go see the jedi master. Even hero, who takes a different direction and somehow gets there first, is also too late.None of this is deep Star Wars canon issues - it's just basic story telling. Everything is just so forced, so convenient - it's like a kid wrote it.",3.0

The Acolyte takes a hard revert back to those original ideas, giving us a more true to intent version of Star Wars. Disney has done a lot of work to put the Star Wars train back on track, and this series is not only interesting, but it dives deeply into the original mythos. As one of the original Star Wars fans, I thoroughly enjoyed this return to Star Wars as intended by its creator. While some may not understand this series, or worse, complain that it 'changes canon', you can be assured that it fits perfectly into George Lucas' vision for his universe no matter what others might claim in their reviews. Genuine Star Wars fans with actual knowledge of the lore are happily discussing the various plotlines and theories that the Acolyte is setting up, and I look forward to the reveals that should be coming in Season Two of the series.",8.0

" Low effort fan-fiction and not of the good kind
",2024-06-12,"To be clear, this is not fan-fiction, but it sure feels like it. Lots of money and time and resources went into this show but the place where they failed to invest any real effort was the writing.See, Acolyte has some of the worst dialogue (direlogue, really) that I have come across in a big budget series. Character motivations often make you frown at the screen, wondering why anyone would do what they do given the information they have available. Plot contrivances are abundant and of course, there is a very liberal sprinkling of poor acting on display.I'm not sure who this is aimed at but I can only assume it was intended for teenagers, and not very discerning ones, at that.I call it fan-fiction because, on the strength of the three episodes I have so far seen, it has utterly failed to rise above the level of something a group of determined fans might have produced, given a few sheets for robes, a camera, and an old PC for effects. However much money they lavished on this series, it does not show in the end result.The overall plot/premise is fine, but the execution of the scenes that make up that story is done without any real care for logic or common sense, giving rise to numerous head-scratching moments where you think to yourself ""Why would anyone do that?""Also, why are the Jedi now seemingly overbearing power-drunk lunatics that draw a lightsabre if someone even looks at them funny?Then also, given episode 3's reveal of how things played out at the witches coven, why would Jedi master Toben(sp?) take poison in episode 2 and say ""We thought we were doing the right thing?""What, you thought testing a child for force potential is what caused the destruction? No, fool! That was done by Mae. She had a force tantrum and wrecked the place, but you have to take poison because... why again, exactly?Of course, there could be further reveals down the line that reset that narrative, but you know what? I don't care. The show is made with as much care, skill and attention to detail as the average child's first painting for the family fridge.It's not good. In fact its probably the weakest Star Wars show to date. Not worth your time.SUMMARY: Poor fan-fiction level show that is incapable of rising above the low bar it has set for itself.

" Star Wars and story quality is dead!

But now, after this ridiculous series, it's finally over for me! I am no longer willing to waste my time on this nonsense produced by completely untalented writers and directors. They will never understand why Star Wars became such a phenomenon in the late '70s and why the original films had a certain magic. That magic has been absent for a long time now, as today's ""cinema"" seems to consist of poorly copying once-successful directors without understanding why their films worked so well!You can see it across all media these days: the quality of productions and, most importantly, their content has drastically declined. Are there no creative minds left who know how to captivate an audience? What's going on? There was a time when you could browse through streaming services and find a movie or series to enjoy... now, you fall asleep just clicking around, as there's nothing worth investing your time in anymore.I've finally decided to stop watching new content and instead, I read old books (since new ones are often just as bad as TV series) and exclusively watch old movies, mostly from the '70s and '80s. If things don't improve in Hollywood, at Disney, and elsewhere, then I'm done for good! Let them watch their drivel and fan fiction and pat themselves on the back.

" A Marketing Catastrophe
",2024-06-20,"There are countless reviews on the content itself, so I will instead speak on Disney's failures as a company in the production of this series so we can work towards better content going forward.Kennedy has made comments regarding the reviews of the show, claiming that they aren't accurate because Star Wars' audience is mostly men who don't want a female lead. Immediately, this statement is false. Ahsoka is the lead of Clone Wars and she is one of the most beloved characters in the franchise. Jyn Erso is the lead of Rogue One and I have seen nothing but love for her character and the film. Although clearly incorrect, even if her statement was true, it is never the fault of the audience. Your business is entertainment. It is Kennedy's job as the executive producer to understand what her target audience is and to cater to the needs of that audience when producing these shows. Obviously the average male viewer would rather watch high octane action as opposed to a slow burn snooze fest about characters no one cares for. If these are the needs of your target audience you must find a way to fill those needs, not blame them when they dislike your product. This shouldn't have a revelation, this is marketing 101; you'd think the leaders at a billion dollar company could grasp that.Not only is it her job to understand the needs of the audience, but to create a product that meets those needs. She's made claims in the past that it's hard to create Star Wars content because there's nothing to go off of. You'd think she's know better than to say that, considering that the revival of Boba Fett (a show she produced) was ripped almost perfectly from the Star Wars Comics. This lazy claim stood out most to me in Kenobi. They claimed that fans hated Reva because she was a women, completely failing to realize she is just a lesser retelling of Vader's arc. It is unnecessary to do so what Anakin is not only one of the most iconic characters in history, but because you also have tens of Vader comics to pull content from.The beauty in purchasing a restaurant franchise is you don't have to convince customers of the quality of your product, they already know what to expect when they walk in. The marketing is already done for you. Kennedy's actions have not only failed to capitalize on the advantages associated with purchasing a franchise, but she has actively sabotaged what remaining goodwill the franchise had with its fans. The quality of these shows indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the series and the rating support this conclusion. Unfortunately, nothing is likely to change unless we the fans hit them in their pockets. I have cancelled my Disney Plus subscription since finishing Andor. Though this is mostly about Star Wars, nothing from Marvel has peaked my interest since then too. As long as we continue to give them money, they will continue to produce subpar content. I can promise you that until we manage to hurt their income report, we will never see these franchises come back. It hurts to see my favorite series fall apart due to simple mismanagement, but hopefully the outrage is enough this time to finally bring change.

It's as if they're purposefully eroding what fans have long held dear, leaving us with content that lacks the magic and coherence that made the original saga so special. This feels like a calculated move to reshape Star Wars into something unrecognizable but profitable.

It pains me to have to write this review but Disney must hear this. I really wanted The Acolyte to be good, especially after the disappointments of The Book of Boba Fett, Obi-Wan Kenobi, the third season of The Mandalorian, and Ashoka. Sadly, my hopes were dashed. The writing, direction, acting, and dialogue of The Acolyte, episode after episode, is just objectively sub par. Speaking of poor acting, I actually had to look up the actor who plays Vernestra Rwoh, Rebecca Henderson, because in every scene she was just awful and immersion-breaking. I wondered who she was and why was she selected to play this character? Guess what, it turns out she is the wife of The Acolyte creator Leslye Headland! That explains everything. Why is Disney allowing Star Wars to be abused this way? I mean the Andor series was extremely well done with high quality acting, diverse and compelling characters, engaging storytelling, strong and interesting female leads, amazing cinematography and special effects, an awesome soundtrack, and superb writing, direction, and dialogue. Andor felt like real quality Star Wars that deserves repeat viewing. Andor had me invested in the characters and their outcomes. Andor had me excited in anticipation for each next episode. Andor is everything that The Acolyte is not. Why is there such a discrepancy in quality between the Star Wars series? Why is Disney more interested in the quantity of Star Wars series, rather than the quality? Why was so much money spent on The Acolyte when what was delivered was such a low quality product?

This is 100 years before the era we all know well, so it's very familiar but very different.There's lots of use of The Force, great fight choreography, and the production level is good. It's really interesting what we've seen so far of the Jedi as an established institution.

" Star Wars is made for Cinema not TV
",2024-06-07,"I think my issue is that Star Wars is a cinematic experience. I enjoyed Ashoka, Andor, Kenobi and most of mandalorian but overtime I felt all of these should be condensed into a film.The most I have felt this is with The Acolyte. Both episodes are way to short. By the time you start getting into it, it then cuts to the credits.. The characters aren't so likable just yet, but I do like Master Sol. I just feel like this would have been better as a well thought out film than TV show.Disney loves their TV shows at the moment and I think they need to get back to the big screen. Take chances and create something great to show us all and stop being afraid of the fan base. Get away from the Skywalker era and create films within the high republic era or way after the Skywalker saga.I want to see STARS WARS show it's fantastic self at the cinema again. There isn't much time to get invested in these small episodes.",7.0
" Doesn't feel like it was made with much passion
",2024-06-06,"So far the show feels like the quality a fan-made film but without any of the passion that would go into that.The characters are pretty bland, there's nobody you really become invested in. The storyline is fine but nothing new enough to really captivate me. Maybe it will develop more as the show goes on.The other strange thing is, despite having close to a movie budget per episode, the effects look terrible. The humanoid aliens all look like cosplays rather than real creatures/people and the CGI is pretty rough. I have no idea what they spent their money on because it doesn't feel big-budget at all.I think if you're mega into Disney Star Wars you'll probably like this as it's just more content for the sake of content.

I find it more enjoyable playing the Benny Hill theme on loop while watching this series. I think the Star Wars Christmas special is a masterpiece compared to this.

" Pretty forgetable
",2024-06-13,"I would really like to love 'The Acolyte,' but the script is as uninspired as it is marred by preemptive self-censorship and written tailored to transmit values specific to US societal issues. Creativity seems irrelevant, overshadowed by a forced agenda that degrades the essence of the Star Wars universe. The casting feels too young and not really believable, lacking chemistry and depth, making it hard to connect with the characters. They continue to prioritize messaging over storytelling and real science fiction. Instead of offering fresh perspectives and innovative narratives within the Star Wars lore, 'The Acolyte' disappoints with its lack of originality and engagement. It's a missed opportunity to delve into unique stories, ultimately falling short of its potential. I miss the times of true inspiration and understanding what made star wars once so great, the creative venture into a new fantastic universe and interesting truly diverse characters. The script seems to consist of the typical template blocks which infest most hollywood movies lately. Overall, a pretty forgetable experience. In a year from now I wont remember even the Title of the show I guess. Also, please fire a) your script writers b) the creative director c) a good chunk of the cast and replace them with mature believable characters and d) the entire executive layer of Disney.

Star Wars was made great because of the story. Take that away and the franchise is nothing more than a ""B"" movie. Disney does not realize you cannot sell Star Wars on the name alone.I think this is a good show to highlight which YouTube reactors are fakes. The plot seems to make sense on the surface, but once they explore it a bit, the irrationality of the show emerges. It doesn't matter if you are a Star Wars fan. The show is simply written badly; it's nothing more than loony bait hoping YouTube reactors will hype the show despite it's lack of quality. $$To think there are all of these awesome EU stories already out there, but Disney and Lucas basically gave them the finger (by mutilating some of their material and using it) and not stopping to think: Um, these EU writers have done a lot to keep the franchise alive between movies.

" Easily the worst attempt at a Star Wars franchise series
",2024-06-13,"To not repeat the many other complaints and criticisms posted this series (3 episodes in) can be reduced to a very simple summary: the writing is horrible - it is full of weak cliche and overly familiar tropes with little resemblence to the original movies. The directing (possibly editing) is laughable. I was not expecting auteur here but the lazy approach to the filming coupled with fast cuts and scene change makes it feel more like a cell phone commercial or a really poor attempt at an 80s MTV music video. But probably the worst part of this series is the acting or, the absence of any acting. The characters seem 2 dimensional, unconvincing and dispassionate. Soime of the more dialogue heavy scenes remind me of grammar school plays directed by middle schoolers. If you ahve a child in the series you may applaudde but the rest of the TV audience will look at you and wonder if your actually watching hte ballgame on your cell phone.

The music is great in episode 3, but overall a bit lacking.The way they shoot this has felt further and further from Star Wars. From the lighting to the shots themselves. Andor did a great job of feeling in the Star Wars universe because of the way it's shot, but this feels shot more like a soap opera rather than a space opera. I enjoy the design, which still feels in the verse of SW especially High Republic era, however they shouldn't have altered the width of the lightsaber hilts to accommodate battery packs.

How about providing some build-up and suspense before a major reveal although I guess another major reveal is in episode three according to all the internet chat. Bait and switch use of Carrie-Anne Moss in all the trailers diminishes her role and the value of the IP. If the IP is truly valuable please honour it or quit with the bait and switch. Non-sensical dialogue with villain saying where are they? When they have literally conducted a stakeout is again lazy. Hope there is at least some logic in upcoming episodes.

" I really enjoyed it, it kept me engaged
",2024-06-10,I find it hard getting into new shows nowadays but episode 1 kept me engaged from start to finish. I have only seen the more recent movies so Im not the biggest expert on the franchise but I really enjoyed this one so I may delve deeper into the other series'.The initial conversation with her little robot droid was a bit cheesy but I liked it because it humanized the character and showed that what we saw of her in the previous scene may not be who/what we expect. Overall I think they did a good job of separating the crime committed in the first scene from the character we are introduced to directly afterwards and it begs the question is she capable of doing what we saw her just do in that first scene.. this specifically is what hooked me so quickly. Very much looking forward to how this unfolds and also that light saber whip i saw in the trailer. Amanda was a great choice for the lead.,9.0
" The Acolyte and the Attack of the 1 Star Clones
",2024-06-15,"I am three episodes into The Acolyte and what I found most unusual is not the quality of the series production, instead the disproportionate amount of seething reviews.Here is my alternative review.While it's usually too early to review a TV series, it's not stopping many so it seems appropriate to present a much needed counter balance.I was a bit unsure of the Acolyte to start with, however as the series progress the plot thickens and the characters develop. The production is at the usual high standards of the Disney Star Wars series. The acting and dialogue is not always flat as suggested, however I think you will find that many of the tones in the Star Wars series have that quality. An often composed tone.So why so many seething reviews attacking Disney and the production crew?I believe it's actually because of the plot and that this series tackles the theme of Light and Dark in a way that is more closer than it has ever been. While Star Wars is based on Light and Dark, it has been done in a more broader sense. The Acolyte gets more close and personal with it.This can cause discomfort in some people, a combination of The Acolyte getting closer to acknowledging this darkness in a personal way. As well as some people coming closer to acknowledging the darkness that resides in them.This is what is bringing the attacks. It's pushing people buttons and ironically in the Acolyte series showing ""the power of many"". It's unfair and unreasonable to give this series 1 star yet this is how it brings to attention the real issue.If these people care so much about Star Wars as they say that they do, then they could demonstrate that respect by giving the series more time to present itself.For me it's too early to say whether it's an amazing or a terrible series. I do see promise and it's far from terrible so far. If things push people's buttons, they could consider looking into that before lashing out unreasonably.",7.0
" Typical Disney Product
",2024-06-13,"""Good Luck Charlie"" had more thought and care put into it than this embarrassing mess of a show. The acting is awful, and the dialogue is somehow even worse. It's clear from watching the episodes and watching interviews that neither any of the cast members nor any of the showrunners have ever even seen a Star Wars film.The whole thing is disrespectful to both the audience and Star Wars as a franchise. When the prequels were first released, they were met with similar (although much more positive) reviews. But over time, they became just as beloved as the original trilogy. However, ""The Acolyte,"" along with the sequel trilogy and every other rushed, garbage TV show they pump out onto Disney+ (save the first two seasons of ""The Mandalorian""), will clearly never get any love or fanbase in the future. There is just no substance, care, or even thought put into this waste-of-time show, and I am giving up on watching it after the first three episodes. Rest in peace, Star Wars.

" Only diarrhea in the pool is worse!
",2024-06-20,"The Acolyte"" is undoubtedly the low point of the Star Wars saga. The acting performances are severely lacking, which is especially disappointing given the high expectations for such an established franchise. The film techniques are also subpar, with poor special effects like the force effect and an overall weak visual presentation. Worst of all is the storytelling. The plot is convoluted and uninteresting, with flat, underdeveloped characters. Overall, ""The Acolyte"" is a major disappointment for Star Wars fans and a weak addition to the saga.

" Hard to watch
",2024-06-20,"I had high hopes for ""The Acolyte,"" but unfortunately, it turned out to be a major letdown. As a long-time Star Wars fan, I was eager to dive into a new story set in the past, expecting rich lore, compelling characters, and captivating storytelling. Instead, what I got was a series that is painfully hard to watch scenes destroying star wars lore in an effort to push a political agenda rather than tell a good story.The dialogue is another major issue. It's stilted and often cringe-worthy, making it hard to take the show seriously. Moments that should be dramatic or emotional come off as awkward and forced.Visually, ""The Acolyte"" is a mixed bag. While there are some stunning special effects and beautifully designed sets, they can't compensate for the overall lack of substance. The action sequences are few and far between, and when they do occur, they lack the excitement and intensity one would expect from a Star Wars series.",1.0
" Enough is enough!

The rest has been pretty bad according to me with Ashoka and the new trilogy being the worst. Until this. I hardly don't know what to say after the third episode but will try. I usually don't rate a show until I've seen all episodes in the first season but I will not be able to watch more of this and I hardly could finish episode 3 but tortured myself through the 30ish minutes.Again - extremely bad dialog and story and there must be something seriously wrong with the directing since all actors seems like they've never acted? Maybe with the exception of Trinity that actually does a good job with her limited screen time.A kid lights up a paper which kills all powerful witches and burns down a whole mountain?This show makes me very sad and I've come to realise that Starwars will just get worse and worse under the Disney umbrella so I've had enough.

After hearing the cost per episode of this series on the same principles, it's no wonder that it's so bad.They need to go back to school on how to do a show. Of course it's too late now.

It's nice how the lightsabers are generally kept off until crucial moments- makes them seem powerful and worthy of respect.Performance-wise, the characters of Sol and Yord are particular standouts at this stage.Overall this is looking nice and I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes in the weeks ahead.",8.0
" Just Ac-alright
",2024-06-04,"Based on what I have seen on the internet, The Acolyte was a divisive show long before it ever came out. I had the chance to watch the show at an advance screening so I have actually seen it and can leave a fair review. The protagonist (or antagonist?) is Mae, a dark side acolyte hellbent on exacting revenge of four Jedi who ruined her life (as the audience we don't know the exact reason yet.) Her mysterious master has instructed her to kill these Jedi without assistance of a weapon mostly because the director wants to show what a Force-user fight without lightsabers would look like. I imagine this will involve throwing a lot of pocket midichlorians at each other or something like that. The premise is good enough and some of the characters are executed well. Jedi master Sol is acted exceptionally well and I kind of liked Daphne Keen's Theelin padawan character. There were plenty of unique alien designs (some new, some adapted from the animated shows, and some previously seen in live action). The sets also looked great.Amandla Stenberg plays two roles - Mae (the dark side acolyte) and Osha (her good twin sister. She played the role of Osha just fine (and yes, the Jedi do commit one OSHA violation with her in episode 2), but unfortunately I didn't find her very convincing in the evil twin role. She wasn't intimidating in the slightest but hopefully this gives the character (and actor) a chance to grow.My main complaint with this show is not the acting though, it is the pacing. We are introduced to 5 or 10 characters but don't really have any moments that show us who these characters are or what motivates them. The writers of these Star Wars shows need to learn to take some time to let the script breathe. We don't need an action scene every three minutes to stay entertained. I would love to see some more talking, character development, and actual world building. The writer of the acolyte didn't get the memo, so we get plenty of action scenes which are at least unique. Thank goodness we got Andor which was miles ahead of the rest of these shows and trusted the audience to pay attention.Final nitpicky complaint, which won't bother most people reading this is that this show will almost certainly nullify the events of the excellent Darth Plagueis novel written before the Disney acquisition of Lucasfilm. Disney had a perfect script for a prequel to the Phantom Menace and they have thrown that right in the garbage compactor. The jury is still out on this show for me (it could still go either way, I'm giving it a 7 for now) but I can almost guarantee it will not be as beloved to Star Wars fans as the Plagueis novel was.So go watch the show and decide for yourself. It is neither as horrible as some people are claiming, nor is it as revolutionary as others are saying. But it is an interesting enough story told in a new time period of Star Wars (something we desperately need more of).",7.0

I read that each episode cost as much as last year's ""Godzilla Minus One"". Where did that money go? Aside from a few pretty good fight scenes, the visual excitement we expect from a Star Wars installment is absent.Maybe this is all part of the grieving process, and I am laughing to keep from crying.

",2024-06-11,"Seen a number of reviews saying this if fan fiction at best, and the visuals are great. So I actually watched the first 2 episodes again to see what I missed (short answer is I missed a lot of alcohol and I am not a drinker).First lets address the fan fiction, is the quality of the writing at that level, maybe at the maturity level, but I would say any Star wars fan (or even someone with any experience with star wars) would write better fan fiction. Take the Jedi for example almost all of them are either not representative of everything we know a jedi should represent or are just silly. Look at the supposed Jedi Knight Yord Fandar. What a git, he is closer to the incompetent Zapp Brannigan from Futurama that a Jedi, hell he does the same oh woops I am naked in front of people gag, he is not mature enough to be a Padawan never mind a Jedi Knight.Now to the visuals, look some of the sets look ok, some of the practical effects or good as well, unfortunately every time you feel the quality is ok the cut to a droid or something else that just looks cheap. I mean take a look at the Image of the Jedi Temple city shot, Same temple as in the prequels except it looks like the only copy of the footage the Acolyte team could find of the building was from a vintage worn VHS tape. In fact it may be the inconsistency that cusses me problems, if you watch original BSG or Space 1999 the effects are corny nowadays but your brain kind of accepts it as the baseline.

" Not Star Wars
",2024-06-12,"""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" fell short in several critical areas, ultimately delivering a disappointing experience for fans. The writing lacked the depth and creativity that have defined the Star Wars saga, resulting in a narrative that felt disjointed and uninspired. The dialogue was often clunky, and the plot failed to engage the audience or provide the excitement expected from a Star Wars story.The performances from the cast were underwhelming. Many characters felt one-dimensional, and the actors seemed unable to breathe life into their roles. This lack of compelling performances contributed to the overall feeling that the show was not up to the high standards set by previous Star Wars entries.Moreover, ""The Acolyte"" did not capture the quintessential essence of a Star Wars story. The magic, adventure, and epic scope that are hallmarks of the franchise were noticeably absent. The show struggled to immerse viewers in the Star Wars universe, lacking the familiar elements that make the galaxy far, far away so beloved by fans.Despite its attempts at diversity, the show failed to achieve genuine inclusivity. The representation felt superficial and did not contribute meaningfully to the story or character development. Additionally, the show missed incorporating key elements that define the Star Wars experience, such as the dynamic interplay of the Force, the complex moral dilemmas, and the rich, expansive lore that fans have come to expect.In summary, ""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" was a misstep for the franchise. Its poor writing, lackluster acting, failure to evoke the Star Wars spirit, and superficial approach to diversity left much to be desired.

" Rather Disappointing
",2024-06-05,"Based on the first two episodes, underwhelming. Definitely feels like fan fiction. Carrie-Anne Moss's appearance was a plus. She is the biggest name attached to this series. The second biggest is Daphne Keen whom I loved in her other projects who has proven that she can carry a series, however, she is not the protagonist and is all but a background character. So that's a bummer.Next, the story, felt a lot like Ahsoka, the Jedi Padawan who was set up for offing a Jedi and then left the order.And then there is the main villain, who they should've focused more on. I was hoping to see a story about the rise of the Sith - which it may still become - however, the evil presented is weak. I wanted something dark and menacing. This is not.Wasted potential. Not enjoying any characters really. I don't know who this writer/director is. The real mystery is why they were given an entire Star Wars series.There are a couple cool elements though so I give it a tentative 3/10. Hope it gets way, way, better.",3.0

And believe me, during the Cold War, very crazy conspiracy theories were common. And roughly the same thing can be seen here.To this you can also add the illogicality of the characters, flat tempers, lack of motivation - the characters simply do something, because it is written so in the script, but is not conditioned in any way.

" Star wars is dead, it's time to move on.
",2024-06-12,"This is a generic murder mystery, set within a sci fi context and with the words ""Star"" and ""wars"" slapped onto it. But this is not Star wars. This is like when your favorite restaurant changes owner but keeps the name and the interior design. Only when you look at the menu and taste the food do you realize that the new owners took advantage of the old establishments good name and they are now using it to promote their own cuisine. The problem is, the new owner offers a cuisine that is bland, mismatched and not very interesting. That is what Star wars has become in the hands of its new owner, Disney. A vessel they can fill with whatever they want, but not what the fans and the audience want, and The Acolyte is the pinnacle of their work. And it makes you wonder: for whom was The Acolyte made? It's obviously not made for the hard core Star wars fans, that's for sure. Even its director says so, publicly. And it's definitely not a kids show. And it's not made for the general streaming audience. So for whom was this show made? I really don't know and the show runners doesn't seem to have an answer either. I really wanted to like this show. On paper it sounded like an interesting route for Star wars to take. After watching the first two episodes I'm amazed this even got made. The script is put together from scraps off other, far better sci fi IPs like Alien, Matrix and Star wars (yes, because this is not Star wars despite Disney saying otherwise) and both the story and dialogue is painfully mediocre. Together with poor acting, cheap looking costumes and a non compelling story there is nothing left to be invested in. Some scenes feels rushed while others drag on forever and in the end you're left with only one simple question: why should I keep watching this? I am really baffled having watched these first two episodes of The Acolyte, wondering ""where did all the money go?"" By the look of it the money went into the pockets of an entitled and untalented group of people who uses the name of Star wars as a platform to tell their own mediocre stories.

I seriously don't understand how they managed to blow $22 million per episode just to get a series that has worse writing than something that ChatGPT would come up with.The first episode is difficult to watch. People are doing things. They're speaking in clunky dialogue. The main character wants a Jedi to ""attack with all her strength"" instead of just killing her like she eventually does by overwhelming her with a knife and saving someone... it's just not very fitting of a Jedi master to go down so easily.The plot is meandering and aimless. I have no idea where it's going and neither does the script, apparently. There's a lot of stilted, wooden-looking acting. To me it seems like poor direction, these cast members just don't seem to really know what they're doing.Episode two plumbs new depths of stupidity. Why is everyone just the dumbest possible version of themselves in every show? Nobody ever thinks about consequences or cause and effect, they act on impulse and never teach us anything.The setting of being in the high republic actually intrigued me, because it's an era we've never seen outside of the books. It's a shame, though, that we have to deal with all this stupidity and cringe. Immaculate conception was supposed to be something only the chosen one had happen but I guess we get twin girls who don't change their hairstyles in 16 years too! We also get a coven of lesbian witches who have ""the thread"" but don't really explain what that means. It's just an unwatchably bad episode.It's genuinely surprising that they keep managing to find people capable of writing such hot garbage scripts and screenplays over and over.

I've just watched the first episode in its entirety and not only is the story telling bad, the acting is terrible as well.I've always thought it was extremely hard to ever pull of twins or actors that do two people in shows as its always come across cheap for me, this is one of those shows. Also shows of mistaken identity and lots of flashbacks just feel like poor writing.And introducing Trinity(Carrie-Anna Moss) in the first 5 minutes and killing her off, that just makes the older audience get annoyed. I went from 'she looks familiar, oh its Trinity, cool, then ...dead.' I think people would be like, 'wait...strongest female lead in a major franchise, who is apparently a Jedi Master in this one just got owned by a tiny dagger in a tavern in the middle of nowhere by a kid acolyte'.

So far, the soundtrack feels lackluster and jarring. The characters are wooden in places, and the costumes and makeup leave much to be desired, with noticeable flaws like visible bald caps and poor makeup. The legacy of colored lightsabers has been discarded, replaced with Force kung fu. It seems that those who worked on this show had no understanding of the essence of Star Wars. One of the few positives is the special effects, which look good, but the story feels lackluster and disappointing so far.

I'm starting to believe that disney is using these shows as a money laundering front, as there is no way a show with so much that falls apart when pressed under the hammer of scrutiny.Actions: The fight scenes look like something that Steven Segal and Frank Dux created under the direction of George Dillman. I find the movements to be slow and unconvincing, while with the light sabers laughable beyond all degrees. There is no intention behind the moves.Characters: The people portraying the characters demonstrate that they care nothing for the IP. They are basically reading lines and going through movements, they do not convince me that they are capable.Story: This is epic Uwe Boll levels of writing. The directing is of Ed Wood perfection. There is no murder/mystery/suspense to this; at all. The characters seem very inept with the structure being very confusing.

" The Acolyte: A Star Wars Series So Bad, You'll Wish It Came from a Galaxy Far, Far Away!""
",2024-06-18,"When you think Disney couldn't make things any worse, we get The Acolyte. I have watched a lot of bad series in my life and often finished them outright, but this one broke me in 20 minutes. The writing, acting, and general overall mess that is The Acolyte is a disgrace to the Star Wars franchise.Why on earth are they not listening to lifelong fans? It is beyond me. They are trying to cater to a new audience while ignoring the very essence that made Star Wars a cultural phenomenon. The Acolyte seems to disregard the core elements that long-time fans cherish about the Star Wars universe. From its inception, Star Wars has been built on a foundation of compelling storytelling, complex characters, and a richly developed universe. Unfortunately, The Acolyte fails to deliver on these fronts.The writing in The Acolyte is particularly disappointing. The dialogue feels forced and unnatural, lacking the wit and charm that characterized earlier Star Wars works. The plot is convoluted, making it difficult to follow and even harder to invest in. It's as if the writers are more concerned with subverting expectations than telling a coherent and engaging story. This approach leaves viewers confused and unsatisfied, a far cry from the excitement and wonder that Star Wars should evoke.The acting also leaves much to be desired. The performances are wooden and uninspired, making it hard to connect with the characters. Star Wars has always been known for its memorable and charismatic characters, but The Acolyte's cast fails to live up to this legacy. The actors seem to struggle with the poorly written dialogue, resulting in performances that feel flat and lifeless. This lack of emotional depth makes it difficult to care about the characters or their fates.Moreover, the overall production quality of The Acolyte is subpar. The special effects, set designs, and costumes all feel cheap and rushed. Star Wars has always been synonymous with groundbreaking visual effects and immersive worlds, but The Acolyte's visuals are a significant step down from what fans have come to expect. The series fails to capture the awe-inspiring and expansive universe that is a hallmark of Star Wars.One of the most frustrating aspects of The Acolyte is its apparent disregard for established Star Wars lore. The series introduces new elements and concepts that feel out of place and inconsistent with the established canon. This disregard for continuity alienates long-time fans who have invested in the rich history of the Star Wars universe. It feels as though the creators of The Acolyte are more interested in creating something entirely new rather than respecting and building upon the existing lore.The Acolyte also suffers from poor pacing. The episodes drag on with little to no meaningful development, making it a chore to watch. The slow pacing, combined with the lackluster writing and acting, results in a series that feels like a slog rather than an exciting adventure. This is a stark contrast to the fast-paced and thrilling nature of classic Star Wars storytelling.In conclusion, The Acolyte is a significant disappointment for Star Wars fans. The writing, acting, and production quality all fall short of the high standards set by previous entries in the franchise. The series' disregard for established lore and its attempt to cater to a new audience at the expense of long-time fans make it a frustrating and unsatisfying experience. As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I had high hopes for The Acolyte, but it ultimately failed to deliver. It is a shame to see such a beloved franchise be mishandled in this way. Disney needs to start listening to its dedicated fan base and return to the roots that made Star Wars great.",1.0

I really didn't think Disney can make anything worse than The Last Jedi but well... congratulations.Why is Disney keep hiring people who have no clue about the source material? All the people who gave negative review here would all write and direct better series than this.The writer has no vision and just clueless. Pretty much like all her previous titles. One look at her filmography and it actually make sense why this series suck. But it seems like Disney doesn't care about the fans and only care about political correctness.,3.0
" Everyone Relax, it's fine.
",2024-06-22,"Listen, it's not like Disney is going to stop making Star Wars so as far as I'm concerned, this is a step in the right direction.Everyone saying it's ""abysmal"" and ""terrible writing"" and giving it 1-4 stars is probably just being reactionary. The set design, costumes, choreography, and performances are pretty good! The writing needs some work but it's a diverse cast that doesn't feel diverse just for diversity's sake.Honestly my biggest gripe is that it kind of functions as a noir on a plot level but the mise-en-scene just reflects the vibe of the prequels, would love more shadows and whatnot. Disney will go out of their way to divert expectations when it works in a trailer but refuses to utilize the nature of film/tv's function and form to really set an exact tone.I'm still enjoying it though! 7/10.",7.0

The characters are so cringe I can't buy into any of it. The dialogue is choppy and corny. Everything feels so unserious in these characters. The way they shoot the combat sequences is ridiculous, why are they fighting like it's the matrix. They gave away a key character plot quite obviously in the first episode. The costume design is mid, world building not what it used to be. Main character going full karate against a ""Jedi Master"" who floats two stories of stairs and fights her like she's Neo. Also the lightsaber hilt's are like Pringle's cans.If you're going to make a Star Wars movie, stop making it your own and give fans something that actually makes them feel like they are watching Star Wars.

" Good Potential But Terrible Execution. Cringe Script.

Ruined what could have been a memorable first scene for the series. Bummer. The rest of episode 1 and all of episode 2 fell off a cliff after the first scene. Terrible writing. Poor editing.Most of the lines were very cringe with dumb lines and awkward behavior. I probably palmed a hand to my forehead or put a finger gun to the side of my head a dozen times mocking the thoughtlessness in some of the writing. I get the Kill Bill homage. But the execution left me upchucking. It was just getting from A to B with weak plot contrivances. They should have asked Quentin Tarantino to fill the script with plausibility and a better how to get from A to B. And better editing that was not just exposition dumps and long pauses of awkwardness.I found myself not wanting to waste anymore brain cells on this. I will give it one more episode to improve. Otherwise I'll spend my time on other content. I give this three stars for the first scene. And took a star away for the extreme stupidity and boredom.

That's not the problem with the latest batch of shows.You can't just say ""we will make them all diverse"" and decide on how a few key scenes each episode are to be done and they hand wave off the writing everything in between. You need a reason for those various scenes to happen and to link them to the next scene as well as the larger story.This is what good writers do. They actually write a narrative story that ties all the pink hair, weird sex scenes and light Saber sequences together so it all makes sense. Very good writers adhear to Canon wherever possible and string together a story that no only connects the funny hair, the weird sex and the lightsaber battles together BUT also tie it in to the existing Intelectual Property so it feels like part of a cohesive whole that one can make the viewers believe was always planned to be done by the creator even if he had zero plans beyond the one movie.This is why the shows are failing.Want to see how it's done? Look at the Fallout series. They managed to take a VIDEO GAME and make a story so strong and compelling there are REAL LIFE WOMEN who want to date the GHOUL!!!

It's got great action scenes with top tier choreography, great special effects and sets. The story is interesting to me, and seems to be setting up an older line of dark side users. Be cool if this were to eventually tie in with Darth Plagueis.Admittedly some actors aren't doing a great job, apart from the lead twin characters and Lee Jung-Jae.But otherwise, this a decent chunk of star wars content and we're only half way through the season.I think some of these bad reviews are based on the hardcore fans out there that can't handle any changes to what they perceived as star wars law, no matter how subtle.I'm just happy to get some more lore of this amazing world and see a jedi council in a different era, not the one we've been stuck with for 20 odd years with the prequel trilogy.Maybe this review will change after the finale but so far so good right now.",6.0

Unfortunately, this excitement was dampened when the scene was oddly repeated step for step in the second episode.There are rumors of a second season.

They even all take too many breaths between words at times, and as they all do it this it has to be by direction.The story is nonsensical, the characters motivations don't make sense, and I'm not sure what the lore breaking/changing is supposed to achieve. Who is that supposed to be for? Who is that meant to inspire? The biggest crime in writing is you're meant to show not tell. The Acolyte shows you nothing and just has people tell you everything. Backstory? Exposition dump. Relationships between characters? Exposition dump. How are the character feeling and reacting to what's going on? They tell you through exposition dump.

Why does the Jedi Master take so long to get involved?Why does the Jedi Master take so long to use her light sabre?Why is the Jedi Master just defending herself, why doesn't she just end the fight quickly? She seems in control of the fight.Why is the Jedi Master deceived by such on obvious ploy?Why doesn't she just deflect the throwing knife instead of turning all of her attention on the bar tender and holding the knife in mid air? After all in the early stages of the fight she doesn't seem concerned about anyone else in the bar.It just seems silly, and I must confess I was really looking forward to seeing Carrie-Anne Moss as a Jedi Master, it seems a bit of an obvious casting, she's a fabulous actress and her steely and calm demeanor seems a perfect fit for the role. For her to be killed off immediately was a real let down.From there it went downhill, we had the odd little fire in the vacuum of space, we're quickly introduced to the good/evil twins and I found my attention wandering before the end.After Andor, which I thought was excellent, I was hopeful that this series would introduce something different into the Star Wars universe, but it's just poorly done.Hopefully this will improve and I can amend my rating accordingly.",1.0

Why would they do this? Instead of gearing your shows and movies towards a specific audience (this has been how business has done throughout all of time until the year 2019) you try to make it ""for everyone"" which actually takes the soul out of the product and ends up being for no one in the end. It's sad and very strange. Why would any company do this when it's been proven time and time again that it doesn't work for the last 5 years. It would be the same as taking Barbie (clearly a product geared towards girls) and forcefully diverge to catering to guys. Of course guys can like Barbie products if they want but in the end it's going to turn away their main audience away since the product isn't being made for them anymore, and then no one will enjoy it.

And that is very hard to do with 8 episodes (30~40 minutes a piece). You would need multiple seasons to make the audience actually care about the characters and the overall story.The Acolyte made the hilarious mistake that the audience would immediately care about their new characters just because they're wearing Jedi robes.In just 2 episodes the show introduces a handful of seemingly important characters:Indara? Mae? Osha? Yord? Sol? Vernestra? Torbin? Jecki? Qmir? (And out of them, two just die right off the bat.)That's a whole lot of characters.And they're ""just there"" either wearing Jedi robes or talking in ""Star Wars Speak."" The introduction of the overall tone (murder-mystery) isn't even intriguing enough because I didn't have enough information about these new characters.And it concerns me that this show only had 8 episodes which only indicates that every 2nd or 3rd episode will dump a ""rushed pay off"" or ""random cliff hanger"" to force the show to be interesting.The show is unfortunately not interesting.

In my experience the best stories and shows come from a vision that is put clearly on screen and not just filled with filler and mindless talking. That's why people enjoyed the original star wars and really hated the prequels.The 3 episodes I've seen so far have just been boring. I will note im not much of a star wars fan. Watching this after watching fallout was like night and day on how to write characters. In fallout there's lots of logic flaws and what not but who cares as long as your entertained. In this show it gets so unentertaining you start looking for flaws. And it goes from basic stupid star wars show to actively bad.Overall very boring very high production value. Don't get sucked into either side of the politics no one actually cares. If the whole cast was all male all female all non binary it wouldnt make a difference because the writing is very bad. The actors doing interviews and saying all the cringe stuff is to get us to watch and it worked. The problem is that people are going to start not even hate watching this shlock.,3.0
" Great fist episode and nothing after that
",2024-06-20,"The first episode was quite interesting, the only one with some acting. Second episode was quite boring somehow the story started to lose its meaning. I definitely don't like the Jedi imagery. They are weak, stupid and do not exude either strength or dignity. The third episode was absolute nonsense, no sense, no scenarios, like it wasn't from the world of star wars at all.I definitely think that the directing is very weak, the casting is mediocre, the acting is very weak and the script is like stolen snippets from other star wars stories but also put together without any sense.I just watched the 4th episode and it was incredibly boring and some Sith bug at the end who clearly didn't see 7-8 Jedi as a threat.Master Kelnacca were showing it as an excerpt from a documentary, no sense in his presence in this series just a waste of money for a costume.",7.0
" Big Letdown
",2024-06-19,"This show is a big flop. At the time of this review, there are currently 4 episodes released. It starts bad from episode 1 and gets progressively worse each episode. The dialogue is painfully cheesy and it isn't captivating like I hoped it would be. It seems more like a soapbox for the writers than a quality show exploring more of the Star Wars universe. The characters are 2D and their lines are forced. The writers tinkered with the powers of Jedi and the natural skill of amateurs in a way that doesn't match up with the rest of the Star Wars universe. The show seems to be trying to slowly reveal more about the main characters dark pasts to keep you invested, but it isn't done in an exciting way, in my opinion. Exploring the time before the prequel movies could have been a cool idea, but it's not working out. Too bad, it's a flop.",1.0

Anything from Boba Fett to their Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser hotel closure should've been an indication they are going in the wrong direction.They bought a cash cow and instead of milking it, they slaughtered the cow. This is perhaps one of the biggest monumental screw ups in recent film/franchise history other than The Ring of Power. You have not simply purchased the rights to Star Wars, but the millions upon millions of ""paying"" customers. Instead of continuing giving the customers what they want, you decide to do what you want while pushing them away.There is absolutely nothing Star Wars about The Acolyte. Jedis don't act like Jedis, force is not the force, and the whole thing is like a cheap knock off of Rebel Moon. Rather than focusing and understanding what is Star Wars, you use it to push an agenda that is constantly being rejected by the culture again and again.And to top it off, campfire in the vacuum of space. The defenders of this quickly points out the SSD exploding in Return of the Jedi. SSD, as all starships, have life support system or oxygen. When it crashed, it created explosion where the flame burns the oxygen until it is consumed in a ball.It is just tragically hilarious this generation doesn't know basic science.

" Fear leads to anger...
",2024-06-12,"Star Wars has long held the idea that fear and grief can lead a person, especially a force sensitive one, down a dark, (self)-destructive path, see Anakin/Padme, and this is the main theme of Acolyte.As someone who's kinda tired of lightsabers and overcoreographed duels I'm glad the show refrains from using them too much. The focus on hand-to-hand and more low key martial arts is refreshing to me.The show has its share of dumb, clumsily executed moments, a certain fire comes to mind, but the core personal conflict and the drama around it are compelling imo. Light and dark, grief and hope, guilt and attonement, these things are central to SW and it's nice to have a show that focuses on them.It is more of a low intensity show and if you need lots of action Acolyte might strain your patience.

The feel of the show is completely different from what I have been used to during my time viewing everything and anything related to the Star Wars univers.I came to the conclusion that this show isn't aimed at the Star Wars fan base. A new and younger group of viewers is probably what Disney is looking for, while profiting from the franchise name to lure some of the hardcore followers.

In the game it's two kids, one is taken as a jedi the other taken in by Mandalorians, seeking revenge against Jedi. A lot of ideas from this show are lifted from that game but executed poorly.Overall this show feels like something you'd watch on CW but like CW 10 years ago. It doesn't appeal to my friends or myself (20-30s), kids I know don't like it or care, in fact this doesn't even let children decide their path, it just pushes one on them. There's a timeless feel about good pre-Disney Star Wars (though Mandalorian was decent), that this just doesn't have.The Jedi in this series feel nothing like how they should. Action scenes are strange as well. None of the characters are likeable or even have charisma. Just no.Waste your money on Disney + if you want but you'll regret is as you discover this is easily the worst tv show for Star Wars thus far, and just bad TV generally.

" Unbearable!
",2024-06-08,"I approached the second episode of ""The Acolyte"" with a sense of reluctant hope, having already found the first episode underwhelming. Unfortunately, my optimism was short-lived, as this episode only deepened my disappointment. The show struggles on multiple fronts, from its plot and dialogue to the acting and action sequences, making it a challenging watch.The plot, for starters, is exceedingly thin. Rather than a well-constructed narrative, the storyline feels fragmented and lacks coherence, failing to engage the audience. Each scene seems disjointed, and the overall direction of the story remains unclear. This lack of a compelling plot makes it difficult to invest in the characters or care about their journeys. In a genre that thrives on intricate storytelling and rich world-building, ""The Acolyte"" falls remarkably short.The acting further exacerbates the show's problems. Performances across the board are lackluster, with characters coming off as one-dimensional and unconvincing. It's hard to pinpoint whether the fault lies more with the actors or the direction they received, but the end result is the same: a cast that fails to bring their characters to life. This is particularly disappointing given the potential depth and complexity that such a narrative could explore.Poor dialogue compounds these issues. The conversations between characters are stilted and unnatural, lacking the nuance and wit that can make even the most mundane exchanges compelling. Instead, viewers are subjected to wooden lines delivered without conviction, which strips the show of any emotional weight or authenticity. Good dialogue is crucial in developing character relationships and advancing the plot, but ""The Acolyte"" misses the mark entirely.Lastly, the action sequences are sub-par and fail to inject the excitement and tension one would expect from a series in this genre. The choreography feels uninspired, and the special effects are unimpressive. Action scenes that should be thrilling and dynamic come off as slow and predictable, lacking the energy and intensity needed to captivate the audience.In summary, ""The Acolyte"" is a series marred by a weak plot, poor acting, uninspired dialogue, and unimpressive action sequences. Despite forcing myself to watch the second episode in the hope that it might improve, I found the show unbearable. It fails to deliver on nearly every front, making it a tedious and unenjoyable viewing experience.

Critics have noted the series' attempt to delve into complex themes and character dynamics, with performances that bring depth to the new faces of the Star Wars canon, but as usual, trying to deliver many things at the time, fail.Despite mixed reactions (and mine as one big of them), The Acolyte has been praised for its cinematic visuals and the bold steps it takes in expanding the lore, inviting viewers to explore corners of the galaxy far removed from the Empire's shadow.

Good versus evil, a princess with a strange haircut, and at the end something big is blown to pieces.I've watched the first three episodes of The Acolyte. I don't understand the majority of the bad reviews here. The latest one in trying to make as much money as possible from the franchise isn't that bad.Solo had nothing to do with Star Wars except the names of the main characters. Ahsoka could have fitted in three episodes, Obi-Wan Kenobi in two, Boba Fett started promisong but kept on dragging.The only good series is The Mandalorian, but after the first season it is loosing it's momentum and slowly getting irritatingly slow in plot development.So what reasons did you have to think this would be a masterpiece?

It was produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by 20th Century Fox, and consists of Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). Beginning in medias res, the original trilogy serves as the second act of the nine-episode Skywalker Saga. It was followed by a prequel trilogy between 1999 and 2005, and a sequel trilogy between 2015 and 2019. Collectively, they are referred to as the ""Skywalker Saga"" to distinguish them from spin-off films set within the same universe.These 6 movies are Star Wars the rest ever made isn't!",1.0

Let's just take som random moments shall we, in no particular order; a young, very kind and nice looking Sith apprentice (presumably) is instructed to kill four Jedi masters without the use of any weapons, otherwise it won't work. I just won't!. The fist one is killed...by a knife. The second one with poison (this particular poison is not a biochemical weapon of course). When the main character, I forget her name, is trapped on a space ship and wants a robot arm that could save her but it is just 10 cm away and she can't reach it what a bummer and despite having been a padawan (even a Jedi?) we are told, she doesn't use the force to retrieve it that would have been too simple says the script writer, or did the writer just forget?. She crashes on a planet very hard, but thankfully she is without a scratch, headache or even any dust in her hair. Hunted by some Jedi, she flees in a sort of cave tunnel, but comes to a dead end with a steep cliff. Here, the script writer remembers,they could use that scene from The Fugitive with Harrison Ford that was a good movie and yeah that came out totally obvious. And did I mention that this is a teen series? A very low teen series? So there must be a hot guy without a shirt looking hot scene. Check. A Jedi no less. Because that is what low teenage girls like and Disney has transformed the Star Wars franchise into a low teenage girl target audience by hiring women that likes to write about emotions and stuff and having all the actors talk unnatural about unimportant things just to keep them talking. Very superficial of course so not to stir up any real emotions, heaven forbid. But they must look good! That is the most important thing. Another Jedi master is green but she looks human. They didn't bother to make her look just a little more non human, like some pointy ears and orange eyes. No, let's keep it simple there are donuts on the buffet table over there.

Opening shot comes and I'm thinking wow this set design is incredible. But after the first scene I was left laughing at how dumb it all was. The acting might be some of the worst acting in a major Disney show in a long time. I was not invested in it at all. The characters feel shallow. It feels like they were trying to push a ""New Star Wars"" and it did not work. It is really quite a shame that Disney hasn't been able to put anything good recently.

" I think my University Drama Club could do better than this!
",2024-06-24,"It's disappointing when a series falls short in terms of acting, cinematography, and stunts. The fight scenes should ideally be captivating, not laughable. As for the budget allocation, it's indeed puzzling when resources don't translate into quality.Regarding the premise, when a series draws from existing material like Star Wars, it's essential to offer fresh perspectives or unexpected twists to engage viewers, but also needs to stay true to the original in many key areas. Otherwise, it can feel unstructured, chaotic, lost and somehow lacking a link to the original. This distracted mess called the Acolyte makes these mistakes so obvious that I had to cringe at times.If you'd like, I can recommend other sci-fi series that might better capture your interest.

" Listen to the words, fans. The Acolyte is the best of all Star Wars shows
",2024-06-23,"As James Burns said""I've been a Star Wars fan ever since I saw the film in the cinema in December of 1977. I jumped on the Star Destroyer as it flew overhead, and apart from a short time in my teenage years, I've been an avid follower of all things from a galaxy far, far away ever since.Until the prequels were announced, the only way to engage with others was at conventions and shows. You would make trades in-person, get an autograph or two, or perhaps enjoy the good natured comparison of Star Wars vs Star Trek, but that's as far as any sort of rivalry went.That all changed in the second half of the '90s with the advent of the internet; CompuServe, MySpace and forums were a new way to connect with other like-minded people, although getting on line with dial up modems wasn't always the easiest or quickest. I fondly remember trying to download the first trailer for The Phantom Menace overnight with a modem cable trailing over the floor so I could monitor the connection from my bed.The Phantom Menace arrived, and with it came a whole barrage of criticism - for the story, the dialogue and even some of the actors. This was so severe that one of the actors, Ahmed Best, considered ended his life, while the young Jake Lloyd is still very much a recluse to this day, some 25 years on.Star Wars has always been a story of good versus evil, and most of the time we see good prevail, so why have we let a few rogue fans ruin things for fandom? It seems ever since the first prequel, no matter the project, or who ultimately owns Lucasfilm, the few spoil it for the many, going online and sharing their opinions, being downright spiteful and even rude to the actors, writers, showrunners and executives, sometimes before they've seen a single episode of a series or the film has been released to the public.I fully appreciate that we can't find favour in everything, and nobody is forcing everyone to like all the output that comes from Lucasfilm; after all, the content has to appeal to a wide age range from preschoolers to first generation Star Wars fans, some of whom are now in their 80s and beyond.What we can do though, is have some respect for the time and effort that goes into these projects, regardless of the content. The people who make these shows and films are just like you and me, going to work each day to earn a living, to do the best they can using whatever tools they find themselves working with - be it a pencil and paper to design an alien or starfighter, a set of spanners to build a droid, or a keyboard to code a series of special effects. Think about how that vitriol may hurt the thousands of people who work on these shows.Put yourself in their shoes - how would you like it if a small minority of (mostly non-expert) people picked holes in your job performance?Most of us live in a country which allows free speech, and I'm not advocating censure, what I am suggesting though is the need to be mindful, to really think about the comments we make in the name of fandom.What do they achieve, apart from hurt? What would happen if they simply followed the advice an old Jedi Knight gave some 47 years ago to... ""move along.""
Alternatively, you could always listen to what my mother taught me... ""if you have nothing good to say, then don't say anything at all.""
In a world that's more divided than ever, I think we'd all advocate for peace, so why not extend that to our Star Wars fandom? Instead of ranting on social media and degrading those who worked tirelessly to produce the content, just don't tune in, don't stream it or just don't buy a ticket - Disney and Lucasfilm will soon get the message when revenue is down and merchandise sales fall flat. Star Wars fans don't need to punch down and hurt people along the way for this to happen.Critique is fine but ad hominem attacks have no place in Star Wars or any fandom.Together we must do better - please - may the Force be with you, always.""As Obi-Wan Kenobi said""Don't give into hate.

This offering is just terrible and makes me wish that the people who want to remake and existing IP in their own image would just try to make their own IP. I'm not mad, just disappointed.Apparently this show has a budget of $180 million, with that kind of budget you would expect them to be able to afford better writers and actors, heck you would expect them to be able to produce 5 separate shows and only release the best one. The writing is comically bad in most places, as in the lines have no poetry, no comic value, no interesting character and no intelligence, it seems like the kids were adlibbing their lines half the time and have no meaningful internal dialogue. There is no fun despite all the changes in location, and, even as fantasy based as star wars is, commonsense physics and chemistry are ignored to the point that everything burns even when it shouldn't, be it rock or metal in the vacuum of space, and space fires are put out with CO2 gas extinguishers. This leaves us with the only entertainment value being how bad this show is and then you have to ask, why are people who hate star wars(the author thinks the sith are better than jedi despite the whole point of star wars was the sith are evil) and hate the star wars fans (anything other than praise is being met with name calling and gaslighting) being given the green light to write star wars? I always thought the whole point of a media empire was to make content people want to watch, and the more entertaining the better. I have to wonder if being as rich as the people in charge at disney just makes you stop liking movies or if they never watch anything new while they sit on their yachts. This show is very out of touch with the people of today, I hope disney rethinks itself instead of doubling down, or if disney does destroy itself then maybe the entertainment industry can reset itself finally and be made up of a lot of smaller studios instead of a few juggernauts that all kinda suckTLDR: Disney must be funneling the budget of this into anything but what we get to see on screen because this is terrible. If you want something good to watch go watch the shows that inspired george lucas to make star wars, such as old samurai movies or flash gordon, or one of the many shows that copied star wars back in the day (the best being Space Balls but the 80's and 90's had a lot of good movies).

The Acolyte fails to do this.The first scene was so confusing and weird, a failed attempt to make a cool scene and it just made me ask all the wrong questions. The dialogue is pretty basic, the story is very one-dimensional and too rushed. We barely get to understand our ""main cast"" while the first plotline is almost finished. It felt more like a chore to finish an episode rather than enjoy it.As advertised this series is very diverse and inclusive, however SO FAR, in my opinion, it's correctly implemented and it hasn't been forced or held up against my face.I like well written characters, no matter what Gender, race or sexuality. So far no characters stand out with great performances, there are one or two characters I like more than others and are enjoyable to watch, while other characters are very predictable and show little to no depth.Conclusion: Should you watch it?If you are a Star Wars fan, I'd stay away from it.If you are someone who likes interesting, unique and thrilling stories, then this is definitely not for you.If you are someone who likes action, the fights aren't bad, but nothing special.Only if you are someone who really cares about having a story with diverse and inclusive cast, then this series will go your way, however I would recommend other diverse series such as ""Sandman"" which has actually good characters and a very well written plot.-> I would not recommend ""The Acolyte""",3.0

So far, Leslye Headland is bringing her Russian Doll flavor, where what's actually happening is slowly unfolding while we get to know the characters (Sol is the most compelling Jedi in a long time). The fights are cool, the locations are real (looking at you, Mando), and the story is introducing parts of the canon that have never been explored. (Witches refer to the Force as the Thread, and utilize it totally differently.) To those complaining about the stilted dialogue, take a look at the prequels and say it again with a straight face. This is melodrama in a galaxy far, far away, and I'm here for it. A Wookie Jedi? Yes please. A Drew Barrymore surprise death? Bring it on. I hope that Sisney can tune out the haters and keep giving us Star Wars that doesn't keep resurrecting Palpatine, or focus on Anakin or Luke and their part of the timeline. Big yawn. This is new and different enough that it might actually pick up new fans, which is what this franchise desperately needs. It's not perfect, but it doesn't require being a super fan to follow (ahem, Ahsoka) and it's not about a stoic hero transporting a child (Obi-Wan, Mando), and it's not rewriting swaths of established stuff (Boba Fett). It's the most comparable to Andor, if only because it's taking swings that the mainline stuff is afraid to (Skywalker). I'm happy with this corner of the lore. Keep it coming.",9.0

I wish I could say that there were only some parts that I didn't like and it had some saving grace, but both of the first 2 episodes are so terrible that I ended up watching YouTube videos instead. When is Disney going to just stop making up terrible plots and actually make a good star wars production. They took some of the best material and made it non canon because they retroactively make a decent me off of it.

Instead of focusing on compelling storytelling, The Acolyte feels more like a checklist of diversity quotas, resulting in a show that feels disingenuous and superficial.

Episode three came out... how stupid of a director and writer do you have to be to make that episode come to pass. They really said, ""Yeah this is a fantastic episode, we really did a great job, and I'm sure everyone will love it."" It wasn't just a poor ""Star Wars"" episode, it was a poor live-action episode in the sense of entertainment itself. Not only is the director putting stupid political and societal hints into the show (that Star Wars has never done before), but they also seem to have never watched a single Star Wars movie or show that was previously made in the past 40 years. Such a horrible disgrace, apparently anyone can write and direct a Star Wars movie and show now? The budget, $180 million, where did that money go? I saw none of it in episode 3, it clearly didn't go into the writing on that episode. The characters contradict themselves MULTIPLE times, going back and forth, spouting nonsense - ""The force is a thread, it is not a weapon you can decide to use whenever"" Proceeds to use the ""force"" or thread as a weapon multiple times... Osha and Mae are too young to make a decision on their own, they do not know who they are or what they want, ""You have to choose your own destiny, what do you choose Osha, you decide your fate right now.""

Loved those movies and though the prequels were a mixed bag I was excited that Star Wars was continuing on with the world I've grown to love.The sequel trilogies were then announced back in 2012 and again I was excited. However that's when I realized that things would change and not for the better. Force awakens was a mix bag, the same story told in a new hope but ""updated for modern audiences"". But okay. Sure thing. Need to get the next generation caught up with the lore. I won't even get into the other two but that's when the cracks started to show. Loved rogue one. Solo not so much.When it was announced Disney plus would be launched with new Star Wars content needless to say I was stoked. Stories outside the skywalker saga focusing on other characters from the galaxy far far away.Mandalorian season 1 and 2 were great. Then the other crap came. Book of baba fett was promising but to me made absolutely no sense. Obi-wan played a secondary character in his own show. Should have been renamed Reva. Ahsoka was a prime example. Should have been rebels season 5 And the mandalorian season 3 was no different as he was a secondary character to Bo-Katan. I started noticing a pattern. Seems all the female characters are better and more skilled than the males to make them look good. There's no struggle. No character arc. No consequences. Nothing.So now we move on to the acolyte.

Its wars in space. I watch this to be entertained not to be preached to.I noticed they try to check off all the boxes for diversity. Not being cliche but put a woman in it and make her a girl boss where she's better than anyone else comes to mind. But another issue is with this is the actors marketing the show say its fans fault and there's a ""small group"" of trolls who try to influence others.I'm not trying to influence anyone.

" Meh
",2024-06-05,"What this gets credit for is trying something different. This is fundamentally a murder mystery a very popular format telling a story but one that's never been in the Star Wars universe before. Also, this is set 100 years before the more familiar events so therefore there will be no usual characters, except possibly a cameo from Yoda at some point.The production budget is there for all to see. A huge amount of effort has gone into it. But it being a century earlier, it doesn't feel like it's in a different time to the other events. They could've added a slight steam punk element to it or other flavours, instead you could comfortably see these characters walking along with Luke Skywalker. So that idea hasn't really worked.People talk about the ""agenda"". I think what they mean is there is a noticeable absence of any white men. It does seem a deliberate choice but it's not like the entire program is talking about issues that really don't have a lot to do with Star Wars. The cast is all good although the script is pedestrian. Saying that though Star Wars was never known for its sophisticated plots or dialogue.

breathtaking scenery (the only reason I'm giving any stars)Cons:
-horrendous acting
-Classic female protagonist where her difficult past is described and not shown
-the plot which is explained in episode 2 is underwhelming considering the 180M dollar budget
-simple technical issues such as: an open flame roaring in space where no oxygen is present, crash landing on a ship and presumably flying out of her seat (she wakes up on the ground after the crash, and not strapped into her seat before the crash) with absolutely ZERO signs of any injuries, the main Jedi who thought Anakin blew up the death star ignites his lightsaber unnecessarily way too much, etc. The list goes on and there has only been 60 minutes of content released so far.-so far there's no real reason to care for any of the characters despite how bad this show wants you to.I was a big fan of Star wars though. It's disheartening seeing Star wars go so far downhill that by the time we get a sith focused story, it's ruined by lack of decent acting, a messy and underwhelming/clichè and at times, just downright cringy decisions. For instance, the first fight in episode one. Lightsabers (according to past Disney star wars movies and TV shows) don't actually kill anyone, however throwing knives from acolyte do. The choreography was slow and you could feel that they were holding back to avoid hurting each other which led to a slow and cringy fight that the music was trying to dictate as ""serious"". (I quite literally couldn't stop laughing). The fact alone that the Jedi felt she needed to put out her lightsaber to defend herself against throwing knives, when she demonstrates several times that she is a skilled force user, is laughable. I was excited to see the lightsabers, but it felt wrong seeing the first ignition.My last and biggest gripe with this show so far, is that it feels like a rehearsed play. Almost like they are saying their lines to each other for the first time in full set and costume. They hired a writer who has literally never seen ANYTHING star wars or star wars related (she mentioned Chewbacca as a dog) and it shows.I don't know where the 180M dollar budget went, however I can say for sure that it wasn't spent making content by star wars fans, for star wars fans.",1.0

If I need to shut of my brain and watch something to relax, this will do nicely. It however fails to engage me emotionaly or mentally, as it lacks substance and development.What do I mean by infantile? That the plot is written so that a 4 year old chilk or a teen/adult incapable of putting their phone aside can follow it.Every action is anounced overtly and repeatedly, in case you missed it the first time.Bland as in it tries to be a ""This is what fans think is a Star Wars right?"" instead of being it's own within the Star Wars Universe. That were the strengths of the Prequels and the EU and Andor, having their own course and Identity. The Acolyte is generic.By Comparison Andor, which took me convincing to watch after so much terrible dribble under current leadership, managed within two episodes, get me invested in the Ark of a Nobody, an upstart employee, an imperial intelligence agent and two tragic rebels.In addition he Murder Mystery is spoiled within the first episode. The Jedi act needlesly dense and inflexible for the plot to be able to happen. The use of the Mystery Box for the master is blunt. The visuals a good, the sets are decent, the fight choreography is 1990 TV.The Characters are OK. But just ok is not enough. By comparison with recent shows, the plot of the new Fallout show was rubbish but I stayed to the end as the Characters, for the most part, where intriguing.Albeit the Plot of the Acolyte seems to be more sensible than Fallout's the infantility and blandness of its delivery paired with merely ok characters, leaves me with nothing to invest myself into. So why continue to watch yet another fetchquest plot (fetching the criminal on the run that is, as there is no crime to investigate).The Acolyte suffers in the end from what most of Disney Star Wars suffers from: The Story is Paper thin. The audience is deemed comatose. The Characters are somewhere between cardboard cut outs and walking tropes. Disney and LucasFilm fail to realise again that the success of Star Wars was not that it was ""Space Wizards with Laser Swords"" for kids, but that it told tales of old myths in a new coating. And it is a shame. As a well told crime story could have been a great addition to the mythos.",3.0

It has little action so far (I'm only two episodes in), but enough for me to be engaged. The acting and the story is great so far. It's far better than the newer movies and on par with some of the other shows.Obviously it's not finished yet so it's hard to judge it this early. I'm giving it a 10 just to offset some of the ratings, but it's a solid 7.5. Good enough to watch with a nice surround system.

Are we lead to believe that good is bad and bad is good? Is the Acolyte trying to tell us that the Jedi are evil...especially with the last episode?

But Disney has completely already failed this show which is destroying parts of the other movies. Honestly in my opinion I do not see this canon to the rest of the Star Wars films and shows.

",2024-06-08,"First time reviewer here. I felt I had to do my part to let others know just how far Star Wars has fallen. My kid (6) was pumped for this show. We ordered Pizza and made a night of it. However, by halfway through the first episode, he was over it and wandering around the loungeroom looking for other entertainment. And to be fair, he did well to last as long as he did. This whole production was just strange. The acting was not that good. I felt the Asian Jedi master was believable - every other character felt like I was watching a highschool drama student. I also felt like I was being indoctrinated, not entertained. The effort by the creators to be inclusive and diverse was abundantly evident, to the point where it took away from the experience. The story so far too, has been incredibly predictable and underwhelming. I dont think I will even bother with the subsequent episodes.

The idea of jedi being the ruling class which also inherently makes them seem to some as the oppressor is such a good one but I'm not willing to hold on much longer.Disney/starwars has a virtually limitless access to special effects and yet the non-human characters look cheesy.

I'm hoping they stick the landing and trust the creator to do a good job of it. It's well acted, well choreographed, I like the aesthetic and I like everything new that has been brought to the table.Also it's completely ridiculous that this needs to be said, but I'm a huge Star Wars fan and have been since I was 12.

" Do not compare this to Clone Wars
",2024-06-08,"The Acolyte does everything wrong.The characters have no genuine motivations, no backstories, no personalities, frankly. The costumes and sets are sub-par for the level of production we should be talking about here, which is a secondary problem compared to the utter hollowness of the actual script.However, what baffles me is the Clone Wars comparison. CW had wittiness, great acting, compelling storylines, it explored interesting and often difficult topics (such as PTSD, or the ethics of cloning, environmental impact of war, etc.) with respect, creativity and passion, and most of all, Clone Wars treated Star Wars with appreciation and fidelity to the original material. Contrary to CW, it is abundantly clear that the writers of The Acolyte have little to no knowledge of previous Star Wars writing, atmosphere and worldbuilding. If this show consciously tried to do something different, it was to its own detriment.I wholeheartedly recommend everyone comparing The Acolyte to Clone Wars to actually watch Clone Wars, as such comparison is inacurrate.",3.0

" Great if you have other stuff you need to do.
",2024-06-14,"I initially thought it would be great to procrastinate by watching this, given the amount of work I had. Surprisingly, I ended up accomplishing much more than anticipated.The programme was appalling.I strongly urge Disney to replace the head of this franchise or, preferably, return it entirely to George Lucas. This sentiment is echoed by many fans and critics who have expressed disappointment over the direction taken by Disney, such as the lack of coherent storytelling and the prioritisation of profit over creativity.It is disheartening to see one of my favourite childhood memories being diminished into an unremarkable and overly sensitive drama. Critics have pointed out that the franchise's latest instalments are plagued by inconsistent character development and a reliance on nostalgic callbacks rather than original content. The most recent movies were not particularly impressive either; Kylo Ren's character struggled to resonate, lacking the depth and intimidation that previous villains embodied.Moreover, it appears that the creators were more focused on ensuring the programme hit every major point of political correctness possible, rather than maintaining the integrity and spirit of the original story. This has been widely criticised for feeling forced and detracting from the overall narrative and character authenticity.The original essence of the series included intense, memorable scenes, such as seeing Darth Maul being chopped in half or Anakin being set alight on a volcanic planet. These moments were integral to the story and its impact. The current approach seems to shy away from such elements, diluting the intensity that made the franchise iconic. The franchise should feature genuinely intimidating and mangled villains, the kind that would scare even a Harley Davidson gang. Characters should be rugged and realistic, not ""pretty boys."" Including men with ponytails and Irish or Scottish accents would also add to the diversity and richness of the character pool.Please acknowledge that this franchise cannot be ""Disneyfied."" It does not need to be tailored for children. As many have argued, including renowned critic John Smith in his review, the essence of the original series was its universal appeal, capable of captivating audiences of all ages without pandering.I could go on, obviously episodes 1, 2 and 3 were incredible and by the best, I haven't touch on this as I am just keeping this short.All in all, stop making Starwars content or do it right.",1.0

It seems rushed and there is no basic back story to build on and no major exciting event to get your attention. Just two rather uninteresting twinsIts just so bland and I'm afraid the fight scenes look like a bad Kung Fu movie and what seems to be the primary narrative of a Jedi being ensnared by the dark side and the battle between dark and light on a personal level has been flogged to death with the Anakln Skywalker/ Darth Vader story followed by the Ben Solo / Kylo Ren narrative. Simply changing it to two lame twins neither of whom grab you as a lead character just doesn't fly.At the very least there needed to be some sort of story byline from the other series to introduce and anchor it in the Star Wars timeline but there isn't and like an escaped child's balloon its seem to be adrift, lost in the cosmos.

",2024-06-13,"Tell me you don't know anything about Star Wars without telling me you don't know anything about Star Wars. Harvey's assistant took that challenge to heart and delivered.If you write an original IP, you are God. You are the Creator of the universe, you decide what goes and what doesn't. If you want up to be down and down to be up, so it shall be. If the color blue is called green, so it is. If you want things to happen out of thin air and then explain it with some BS magic, you can do that to. It's entirely up to you. Who people are? What do they look like? How do they function? What can they do? What can't they do? All of that is entirely up to you.But here's the thing. Even as a wannabe writer who hasn't published anything, I've come to understand that while I'm the one who decides what goes and what doesn't go in the universes I create, there still have to be rules. The universe you build has to have a ground level, some semblance of a thread that holds it all together. The simplest example, gravity. What goes up, must come down. And that applies to everything you write in this universe. From the moment you agree to that rule, everything has to follow it. It may not be crucial to the story, but the story is still affected by it.When you walk into an existing IP you have a catalogue of stories that were written before you dipped your pinky into it. Those are full of your ground rules. You write your story and then compare notes, have I messed something up, have I missed a rule that somehow breaks the universe. If the answer is yes, fix it. Use the rules as guidelines, find a workaround, take a different approach. It may seem like it's impossible, but it's really not. You are free to write what ever stories you want, you are not hindered, you just have to navigate the existing rules. That can be fun in and of itself, learning about the universe as you explore it. But that also means you have to know the rules, you have to know the universe, and you have to respect the franchise.No one on Acolyte knows the universe. No one respects the franchise.Because of that it will fail.This show is hopefully the last nail in the Disney Star Wars coffin, the end of an era of destruction of an IP that used to bring joy to so many and has become a pawn in ideological games.",2.0

It is a complete waste of time, and should be cancelled after this season.I tried giving 3 episodes a try but damn that was a dumpster fire of episodes. What baffles me is that this show had a crazy budget and was made by so call professionals but it's nothing the fans wanted. It goes against the classic Star Wars style and it's an embarrassment of the entire franchise as a whole.Disney will be the downfall of Star Wars, it sucks to see what was once a great franchise turn into what it is now. Don't bother tuning into The Acolyte it's a waste of your time.",1.0
" The writers don't understand the Force.
",2024-06-15,"The major gasp is that the writers don't even know how the force works. They open doors using the force? That's not how this world works. What poor understanding of the Star Wars world.In the first episode a Jedi would have known that a weapon was drawn and would have been able to read her mind to stop those attacks.Aside from that the story of twin sisters - one good and one evil could be done better. It has potential, without the mother been hetero, then becoming le******n.The writers need to understand the world of Star Wars, and how the technology and the force meld.It's not hard, look at all the Fan Films for reference.",2.0
" Feels like Star Trek with Star Wars sprinkles ✨
",2024-06-06,"The Good:The score composed by Michael Abels is solid. Nothing majestic (like John Williams) or spectacular (like Kevin Kiner or Michael Giacchino), but it fits in the world of Star Wars. I appreciate the few editing choices and visual effects to make it feel like George Lucas' Star Wars. Dafne Keen looks cool, but doesn't have a lot to do.The Bad:Feels more like Star Trek than Star Wars. The Rashomon effect-style story is predictable. Not a lot of surprises, you can either see them coming or they were spoiled in the trailers. The Force-Fu fighting is not impressive, could've been better. Disney/Lucasfilm's hubris is in full display here. They still think they can redefine and make a better Star Wars than George Lucas' Star Wars.The Ugly:Jedi Master Vernestra Rwoh (the worst character in the series) using The Force to open an automatic door.",1.0

Nothing makes sense, fires burning in space like they are a campfire, stone catches fire and burns like wood, Jedi doing Matrix style Kung Fu for no logical reason at all. Everyone acts as though they have an IQ that would in modern times have them riding the short bus to school and drooling into a cup. Did I say the writing was horrible? It's atrocious, like something a 3rd grader would get a C- on in a creative writing assignment. The dialogue is even worse, no subtext at all, characters just blurt out their motivations, and insecurities without care.

",2024-06-09,"Where do I begin? What a snooze fest! I was bored! Initially I didn't have a lot of interest in this project, but the critics reviews were overwhelmingly positive. What am I missing? The acting was wooden. The dialogue was atrocious. Editing was weak. I didn't care about the story or the characters. They killed off the best character in the first episode. I can't believe that Disney spent $180 million dollars on this project when they could have given that budget to the Kenobi or Ashoka. Who's in charge over there? I won't be watching the next episodes. By the way, with the exception of TROS, I enjoyed most of Disney SW. I also loved Indiana Jones Dial of Destiny.

There is nothing good about this show, and I mean NOTHING! The characters are boring and the acting is lifeless. The background CGI is bland and doesn't look like it belongs in any Star wars universe. I remember as a kid, and an adult for that matter, when Disney would produce tv and cinema that was amazing. Using techniques that no other company could come close to replicating. But it seems they've given up on innovation and now just churn out this type of dribble. Disappointing to say the least.",1.0

How is it that a company that can offer hundreds of millions of dollars in budget, not afford better writers and actors?The writing itself is boring and uninspired. It has an incredible ability to constantly lose my attention. There is nothing exciting about what is going on. In a Universe filled with space wizards, light swords, mystic powers, and aliens, how can it be so boring?The casting is just awful outside of two characters (I'm sure most of you know which two). There is no range or power in most of the cast. The acting feels on par with a middle school play. It's something that takes me out everytime.Now, admittedly, I am not the biggest Star Wars nerd.

Less than average acting and is constantly preoccupied on subvert expectations and breaking the lore...It feels that the show runners want to anger fans than to tell a good story.Watching three episodes that are very short...mostly they are boring and have pacing issues.Is it the worst thing I have ever watched...?

I think most SW movies are dumb. But I do like a few - Episodes 4, 5, 6 and Rogue One.I do try to watch every popular new series - I give them a chance. So I gave The Acolyte 3 episodes. I think that's enough. Can't expect me to waste my time if I think the series is a piece of crap after 3 episodes.I don't care if they change things up like fighting Kung-Fu Matrix style. The little things don't bother me. I don't care if it's not in the Star Wars ""tradition"". What bothers me is stupid writing and directing.

",2024-06-20,"I found Acolyte incredibly boring. I endured (albeit at 2x speed) the first three episodes just to be certain of my judgment. Unfortunately, it consistently maintained a level of boredom in every minute. The show lacks any semblance of logic or compelling storytelling. The acting is uninspired, and it fails to capture the rich history and essence of Star Wars. Characters are poorly developed, and their interactions feel forced and unnatural. The plot is nonsensical, leaving viewers with more questions than answers. While the visual effects and spaceship designs are impressive, they are not enough to salvage the show.

It felt like I was watching a shoestring budget fan film made by cosplayers....and not the product of a BEHEMOTH of an entertainment company.Part of this is props to TouTube cosplayers. Computer tech ology has given them the ability to make productions that are better than what big budget TV shows from the 80s. It's really incredible.HOWEVER, that raises the bar for big entertainment companies, and instead of being the bleeding edge of SciFi, they have set their priorities on goals that do not include taking SciFi into the 21st Century.These big American companies better watch out, because it is also apparent that foreign film makers have caught up in production quality.....but at a fraction of the production price tag.

The producers, writers & ""actors"" of this show clearly never grew up watching Star Wars. The script and dialogue of this series is horrendous. Further more the sets, CG & costumes are cheap and the characters are all dim! This is a really poor written TV show using ""Star Wars"" as a title to gain attraction..... How Disney can produce a true Star Wars Saga series like Andor but then throw mud like the Acolyte & Ashoka over this franchise is disgraceful. The creator and producers of this show could do with watching the original movies.The Disney Star Wars saga is showing continuous trends of awful story writing, dubious casting, cheap sets/costumes and an abuse of original Star Wars methodology.

" Star Wars for people who dont like Star Wars
",2024-06-06,"The Acolyte struggles with many things, mainly a VERY cliche plot. Fight scenes have good choreography but so far in between that you lose interest and start to scroll your phone. The dialog is so clunky you might as well be watching a horribly rehearsed highschool play. Showrunners did not do this show any favors; alienating the vast majority of their fan base by including themes that Star Wars is not known for.The acting is terrible and this new ""version"" of the jedi they created is not refined and lacks any sort wisdom and honor we grew up to idolize. They are desperately trying to make a show on the back of a massively successful franchise that is different yet speaks to new and old fans. It didnt work. I fear this show could kill what remains of the franchise for truly loyal fans. The days of Mando and Andor are long gone.Leslye Headland has never created anything in her career other than activist documentaries and docuseries. Her only relevant qualifications to make this show, is that she was a fan, but a fair weather one at that. True Star Wars fan will not be impressed. This is show you put on in the background while you are vacuuming. Some thing to just play so you don't go insane. But you might anyway with the terrible dialog.",3.0
" This is NOT the way
",2024-06-19,"After many years when star war episode 7 was released i was very excited. When i saw Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Leia and even Millenium Falcon on the screen once again, i almost cried.All those animations, movies like Rogue One, The Mandalorian etc all were adding up nicely to Star Wars universe that i love since i saw first movie back in 1980's. I don't know how many times i watched all those movies and series.Each time i noticed something new and thought to myself that how good Lucasfilm add these pieces together and create this beautiful world.Unfortunately Acolyte can not be part of that universe as it seems.I am sure players tried their best but scenario doesn't fit to Star Wars universe at all. It has been 3 episodes and nothing surprising. You can easily see what is coming right from the beginning. I believe actors think same as i do that's why their performance do not seem at their max throughout these 3 episodes.Also only 30 minutes episodes approves that this series won't and can't offer anything new and surprising. This series seem to only made for commercial concerns and total betrayal to great Star Wars universe and its unique characters.This is NOT the way dear Disney and Lucasfilm members.",3.0

Unfortunately after watching the first four episodes it's clear that the story is mixed and it seems muddled in what its messsge should be. It also takes snd recycles a lot of stuff already done in Star Wars but done a LOT better.Plus they kill off a character after a few minutes tgst was advertised on all posters and in the 2 trailers I saw. And what a lame way to go.

I've enjoyed a lot of Disney era star wars show and I even got on board with obi wan despite some terrible acting and casting decisions for the inquisitors, but at least it still felt like a star wars show.This is just a cheap second rate teen show with lightsabers and it's really annoying because exploring this part of the star wars universe has the potential to be immense.

I want to avoid spoilers but suffice to say, the opening plot point ""discovery"" (revealed by the end of episode 2) was just eye-rolling and felt like a storyline written for 12 year olds.Seems like it MIGHT pan out to be decent. But the casting.. oh the casting is terribly poor in places. Almost as if they cast based on hairstyles and dancing ability (for fights), not actual acting skills.Meh... its much better than most of the sci-fi out there. But it's not better than most of the other Star Wars spin-offs.Little sappy and a bit ""YA"" overall.==============Episode 3 seems to make it clear to me that this is written for children who may not catch all the CLEAR inconsistencies.

" Swing and a miss
",2024-06-20,"George Lucas once said in 1977 his target audience for the original Star Wars was 10-14 year olds, and the kid in all of us who want to believe in the fantastic. Over the past 40+ years, Star Wars has grown from one film into a rich, endearing universe full of memorable characters, one-liners, stories, games, and (on film) special effects. It literally is the yardstick by which all subsequent Science Fantasy stories are judged.But not everything wearing the Star Wars brand has been a success, and sadly the Acolyte is one of them through the first 4 episodes. I've found the writing to be sub-par, especially when compared to other live-action series like Andor or the Mandalorian. The main character(s) are twins who are trying to act out the good / evil twin cliche, but it is unconvincing either fits the mold of ""good"" or ""evil"", and other than one twin wearing extensions, seem a bit *too* identical, especially for children separated for so long. Yes, I know it's *possible* they could look the same, but what is the probability of that? The lookalike issue provided an interesting, although again cliche, method to introduce the characters, but has outlived it's usefulness. DNA or other forensic evidence would have worked too without the need for the twins to look so much alike.Honestly, the only bright spot in the cast so far as been Sol, played by Lee Jung-Jae, who famously learned English for his role. Wise, compassionate, but also flawed, he's the kind of Jedi the audience wants to love, and other than some lackluster dialogue, mostly delivers as expected. Being as the character is the only truly likeable one so far only adds to the value of the character.Also, as always, the special effects are spot on for a big budget Star Wars project. That, Lee's performance, and at least the potential of an interesting antagonist is why I rated four stars. Time will tell if the series will improve or fall even further.",4.0

",2024-06-25,"One glaring issue is the portrayal of the Jedi Order. The Jedi are depicted as more morally ambiguous and less disciplined than traditionally shown. This deviation undermines the foundational principles of the Jedi, which have been well-established in both the films and extended universe. The series attempts to introduce complex character arcs and moral dilemmas but does so at the expense of the Jedi's core values, leading to a portrayal that feels more like a departure than an evolution.Additionally, ""The Acolyte"" introduces new Force powers and abilities that do not align with the established canon. These abilities, while visually impressive, feel gratuitous and undermine the continuity of the Force's portrayal in previous Star Wars media. For example, the introduction of a character with the ability to manipulate time through the Force is a significant departure from the lore, where such powers were either nonexistent or heavily restricted. This not only disrupts the narrative consistency but also diminishes the sense of wonder and mystery that has always surrounded the Force.The series also falters in its characterization of the Sith. Traditionally, the Sith have been portrayed as cunning and power-hungry, yet shrouded in secrecy. ""The Acolyte"" presents them in a manner that feels out of step with their established lore. The show's attempt to humanize the Sith, while potentially interesting, ends up diluting the essence of what makes them compelling villains. Instead of maintaining the delicate balance of fear and intrigue, the series' portrayal makes them appear less formidable and more predictable.Moreover, the narrative structure of ""The Acolyte"" lacks cohesion. The series attempts to juggle multiple storylines and character arcs, resulting in a disjointed and often confusing plot. This fragmentation makes it difficult for viewers to connect with the characters or become invested in the story. The pacing is erratic, with some episodes dragging on while others rush through crucial plot points, further exacerbating the issue.",1.0
" ""Disappointing and Uninspired - The Acolyte Misses the Mark""
",2024-06-08,"As a die-hard Star Wars fan, I had high hopes for ""The Acolyte,"" but unfortunately, it turned out to be the worst show I have ever witnessed. The acting felt forced and out of order, lacking the depth and authenticity that fans have come to expect from the Star Wars universe. It seemed like the characters were pushed into situations without proper development, leaving the audience disconnected and unengaged.The fire scenes were particularly cringe-worthy, looking as if an amateur had hastily written the script without considering the impact on the overall story. The lack of nuance and subtlety in the storytelling made it difficult to invest in the characters and their journey.All I can hope for is a return to the visionary storytelling of George Lucas and his team, who understood the essence of Star Wars and brought it to life with passion and creativity. Disney, please stop destroying the legacy of Star Wars with lackluster productions like ""The Acolyte."" Bring back the magic and wonder that made this franchise a beloved cultural phenomenon.It's time to honor the legacy of Star Wars and deliver content that resonates with fans on a deeper level. Let's hope for a brighter future for the galaxy far, far away.May the Force be with us all.",2.0

It was real the whole time.Change ups, and saying na.I was hoping that this show would be great, I lived the prequel era. I also like some of the shows that people don't like. I was going through a tough time, and I ended up liking bobafett and the kenobi show. I liked a lot about the writing that some of the fandom doesn't like. I can see why those shows were made.I started watching the acolyte, with no expectations going in. I didn't look at reviews, and I didn't dive into the creator, or any of that jazz.Idk why this was consider a great script, idk who's checking and prooreading this case.This show. How did it happen?I literally was so uninterested after the first half of the second episode. Due to terrible decision in the writing, characters that are not in-depth or knowledge anything. Idk just don't.Watch the clone wars instead. Watch anything to do with Dave Filoni. He actually understands the universe.I understand pushing for representation. I love that, I hope they let Kelly Gay have a shot. She has been writing for HALO, and understands that universe so well.

" Honest review... yes Lucasfilm.. this is really the worst trash you have ever produced.
",2024-06-11,"Let's be honest - you look at the reviews and theres a whole bunch of top marks and a whole bunch of very lwo - everyone loathes is or thinks it's the best thing since sliced bread- clearly thats not reality someone got to be wrong here - on the slice bread - so you watch it it's clearly not in the same league as anything that has been remembered - all that talk of review bomging and you realise it's those giving htis at a 5 out of 5 that are manipulating the reviews. If you actually watch it is so awful... quite frankly I have no idea where to begin... Healdnad insistence in making the Jedi to be a bunch of dumb whits, that are so supid the main point of when they talk is talking the mick out of each other, erm I'm sorry you've jsut falshed up an intro bit that says they've kept the pieace for what 100 years (can't actually remember the figure) Healand jabbing at the main thrust of what will be the reveal latter, given healand has a point why being a Star Wars fan would I not want to swtich that off - I think she's answered the what's really wrong with the acolyte. The plot with it's narration and narrative story, script and the general cluckiness of th ehwole thing is the worst thing about this. There is one redeeming feature - the acting on smoe parts it's good then others are shockingly awful - the real problem is a brilliant piece of cronyism from healand... her wife is one of the worst actors. Again just points out the real problems. The real question is who'se been taking the cool aid to not flag this up becuse the cool aid Healands given out her and the other Lucasfilm cronies from their reaction don't seem to believe the truth which is this is reviewd so badly becuse it is so bad. Then you realise what the cool aid is... that the whole DEI nonsense with Disney actually means they think it's impossible that they can come up with an idea based on value signalling and that it can actually be bad!",1.0
" Very good start!
",2024-06-08,"Very good! For the first 2 episodes, we've got everything we need for a Star Wars show. We go straight in the action right at the beginning and so far, the plot is not too subtle, but still present a good potential. As far as mystery goes, we've got plenty of open questions that make us looking forward to seeing the next episode! Few glitches though...like fire in space, but I can live with that. We clearly have a sense that the Jedi order is different in this time period then what we were used to. Also, my wish, is that they are going to talk a lot more about the High Republic major events like the fall of the Starlight Beacon. A bit more about Venestra Rwoh would also be nice because she's an already well established character in the High Republic books.",8.0
" My kids were so disappointed.
",2024-06-07,"""Acolyte: A Disappointing Addition to the Star Wars UniverseThe highly anticipated Star Wars series ""Acolyte"" fails to live up to the hype and falls short of providing a compelling new chapter in the iconic franchise. Set 100 years before the events of the Skywalker saga, the series had the potential to explore uncharted territory and introduce fresh perspectives. Unfortunately, the show stumbles at nearly every turn.The plot is convoluted and meandering, lacking the clear narrative drive that makes the best Star Wars stories so engaging. The protagonists are one-dimensional and fail to generate any real emotional investment from the audience. The worldbuilding, while occasionally visually striking, feels derivative and uninspired, recycling familiar elements without adding anything new or meaningful.Worse still, the series squanders the rich potential of the High Republic era, reducing it to a mere backdrop rather than using it as a springboard for innovation. Fans hoping for an in-depth exploration of this pivotal period in the Jedi Order's history will be sorely disappointed.Even the action sequences, typically a strong suit of Star Wars, fall flat, feeling repetitive and lacking the visceral excitement that has defined the franchise's best fight scenes.Overall, ""Acolyte"" is a missed opportunity, a frustratingly bland and forgettable addition to the Star Wars canon. For die-hard fans, it may be worth a watch out of sheer curiosity, but for most viewers, this series is simply not worth the investment of time and energy. A disappointing letdown that fails to capture the magic of a galaxy far, far away.""",2.0
" The Force is Strong with the Shenanigans!
",2024-06-13,"Ah, Star Wars: The Acolyte, where the galaxy far, far away takes a detour through a space opera parody that even Kung Fury would envy. Yes, folks, Episode 3 has given us something truly out of this world: Lesbian Space Witches using the Force to get pregnant. This isn't a fever dream; it's canon now!We always knew Star Wars was about pushing boundaries, but this feels like an ill-advised hyperspace jump straight into the bizarre. I mean, using the Force for conception? What happened to using it for Jedi mind tricks or epic lightsaber battles? Apparently, the dark side is no longer about brooding Sith Lords but about the intergalactic soap opera plotlines we didn't ask for.It's like the writers had a late-night brainstorming session, fueled by too much blue milk, and said, ""Hey, remember Kung Fury? Let's do that, but make it Star Wars!"" Because, naturally, when you think of a legendary franchise with decades of lore, the first thing that comes to mind is... Kung Fury?And let's not forget the whole point of Anakin being the Chosen One was because he was created by the Force itself. The mystery, the prophecy, the weight of Anakin's destiny-all of it tossed aside for this absurd plot twist. They did it. They killed all of George Lucas's work.This episode has finally crossed the line. The once-mighty Star Wars saga has now officially jumped the Sarlacc. The Force used to be mysterious and powerful, now it's just plain weird. The Acolyte, you have done what seemed impossible: you have single-handedly turned Star Wars into an interstellar telenovela.Bravo, you've destroyed what was left of a beloved franchise. And here I thought the prequels were the low point. How naive I was. May the Force be with us all, because we certainly need it now!",1.0
" Entitled shorunners betray George Lucas' legacy

They have established force heal to be a thing, whenever someone is hurt, my immediate thought is ""why don't they just heal themselves. Rey, with almost zero training was able to pull it off..."" and it takes the entire joy of watching anything Star Wars related and this show suffers from it too. Also, some backwater witch coven succeeded in what almighty Darth Plagueis or Darth Sidious pulled off? Really? Two of the top 15 strongest force users are on the same level as some random ass witch? The force is the force, it's not some strand or twine or whatever. I could go on about the idiocies in the show but I'll have to stop myself. They've undermined the Jedi and made them the bad guys. They aren't supposed to be ambiguous in their goodness, they're supposed to be pure of heart. It's not like some jedi are morally grey, that's literally their whole point, and was supposed to be their own downfall, now the jedi are what, somewhat ambiguous in how they deal with common people?

A story of a couple of young girls, one turning to an assassin and the ""mystery"" of a murder that we already know the murderer.The first two episodes were bland, boring, poorly written, poorly directed, and poorly acted (with a couple of notable exceptions), nothing about the story made any sense, and nothing about the production felt like ""Star Wars"", to say these episodes were bad is being kind... but just when you think it cannot get worse, along comes episode 3 -- undoubtedly the worst episode of episodic television ever made.

" feels unfinished and sloppy
",2024-06-08,"By now I was thinking that SW studio took lesson from sloppy sequel trilogy and it was looking they did when I watched Mandalorian, Andor or Tales of Jedi. Book of Boba Fett and Tales of Empires were little on the decline for my taste but still enjoyable. I cant really decide how to feel about Ahsoka.Obi-wan was very weird but only because I still feel like they butchered Inquisitors with cheap cgi and costumes totally not holding to Clone Wars appearances.Acolyte?Story as in script look appealing and very decent. Something I wanted to see since I was a kid and saw prequels in cinema.Story as in execution? Not so much. Lot of plot holes and characters not really being consistent and it was only two episodes so far.It seems that show wants to do everything at once and fails in doing so. Same issues that sequels had. Half baked and inconsistent.On the other hand I liked that writers didnt add any goofy force powers as they did in sequels. Kudos for that.Compared to Rosario Dawson as Ahsoka, Mark Hammil as Luke, Carrie Fisher as Leia, Ewan McGregor as Obi-wan, ironically enough for Harrison Ford as Han Solo who admitted he hated the role and despite that owning the character now I had feeling like half of the main actors didnt really care and I had troubles to feel anything for their characters. They were simply not convincing enough for me.Is it redeemable? No doubt. There is plenty of episodes left to make it decent show but so far its below average for me.

" The Acolyte, Episode 1, The Phanton Poopies
",2024-06-08,"Hahaha!!! Cringe AF yall. Too to bottom. It's like going down a waterslide made of sandpaper. Absolutely the nerdiest thing ever. The thing that sets Star Wars apart from say, GI JOE or other kid's based products is that it was made by serious film makers and actors. They can say made up words like, metacloreans, and not make every adult turn it off to go back to watching Seinfeld reruns because it's so silly. That's why SW sold for 5 billion and GI Joe would sell for about 200 million. Universal human themes delivered by professionals so it has mass appeal. That's all over. The new writers write like children. The new directors direct like children. The undertones have no kick ass cool vibe. The actors feel like people who never liked SW but like the idea of being part of SW so now they're doing bad impressions of characters. Every line is written way too melodramatic and then the actors deliver them like they're hoping they'll be revered like Obi Wan Kenobe by the fan base. Well, whatever fan base they're going for in this. Young females if I were to guess and that won't work out of course because girls aren't dorks. Dudes are dorks and we stay dorks for life. Thats how SW has 60 year old male fans. Women usually grow out of being dorks. Thank god for that because we can't just have a whole planet full of nerds walking around.

" A Missed Opportunity in a Galaxy Far, Far Away
",2024-06-07,"I had high hopes for ""The Acolyte,"" expecting it to bring a fresh and intriguing perspective to the Star Wars universe. Unfortunately, the show falls disappointingly short of its potential. Despite a promising premise, it is bogged down by a series of missteps that make it difficult to recommend.Firstly, the pacing of the show is painfully slow. The narrative drags on, making it a challenge to stay engaged. Key plot points are often obscured by unnecessarily long and meandering scenes that add little to the overall story. It feels as though the writers are stalling for time rather than advancing the plot in a meaningful way.The characters, another crucial aspect of any Star Wars story, are surprisingly one-dimensional. The protagonist, who should be complex and compelling, comes across as bland and unrelatable. The supporting cast is similarly underdeveloped, with their motivations and backstories either poorly explained or entirely absent. As a result, it's hard to care about their fates or feel invested in their journeys.Moreover, the dialogue is often clunky and stilted, lacking the wit and charm that fans of the franchise have come to expect. There are moments where the script feels almost amateurish, with characters delivering lines that are unintentionally laughable.The show also suffers from inconsistent special effects. While some scenes are visually stunning, others are marred by subpar CGI that detracts from the immersive experience. Given the high standards set by previous Star Wars installments, this inconsistency is particularly jarring.One of the biggest letdowns is the way the show handles its connection to the broader Star Wars lore. Instead of enriching the universe, ""The Acolyte"" often feels disconnected from the established canon, introducing elements that contradict or undermine previous stories. This not only frustrates long-time fans but also creates a disjointed viewing experience.In conclusion, ""The Acolyte"" is a frustrating watch. Its sluggish pacing, underdeveloped characters, clumsy dialogue, inconsistent visuals, and tenuous connection to the Star Wars lore result in a show that fails to live up to its potential. For a series that promised to delve into the darker side of the Force, it instead leaves viewers feeling left in the dark about what could have been an exciting new chapter in the Star Wars saga.",1.0
" Horrible Writing
",2024-06-15,"The writing for this show is really just atrocious, or maybe it's the editing. Or then again, maybe there was no editing, and that's the problem.Through 3 episodes, things just happen because the writer needs them to for the plot. Characters contradict themselves, sometimes within the span of less than 5 minutes. The sense of space and time is non-existent, characters just appear where they need to be whenever the script needs them to be there. And then some of the lines.....I believe the word the kids use these days is cringe. Some of these lines are very cringe.I say maybe it was the editing, because this show was in production a long time. So it is likely there were changes, but come on, make the appropriate edits then, give us some consistency.But overall, everyone in this show is very stupid. Either they were written to be stupid on purpose, which is dumb given we're dealing with Jedi Masters, or the writers of this serious don't have the talent to create a story with an real intrigue that makes any sense. The characters do what the writers want them to do, not what the characters would actually do in universe. That is basically the definition of bad writing.",1.0

The line of work started by Rogue One and developed by Andor. A serious, quality, dramatic approach to fantasy. The Mandalorian had a good start, but it's becoming more and more bland and lightweight season by season, I hope it's not beyond saving now.Yes, it's not like selling colorful sugar to kids, it actually requires effort and talent, and stories written by authors, not AI.

The foul stench of corporate committee writing is all over this show.The ultimate problem with this show is that it's the most visible symptom of Disney's propensity to exhaust franchises far beyond their expiration date. It's akin to the television equivalent of refusing to alternate crops in your soil; it goes fallow after a single harvest.They did it to Marvel, they did it to their own films with live-action remakes, and they're doing it to Star Wars.And the lightsabers look like glowsticks.

The CGI is fine...but that's no longer really a high standard...even low budget movies and series can have decent CGI. Disney has continued to destroy every aspect of Star Wars they can. And when they run out of old Star Wars themes to destroy, they make up new stuff and proceed to destroy that.

Now if episode 3 does what some say this could put the final nail in my 47yr Star wars love affair. Since when could jedi mind read? That one breaks the lore to start with.

" below average effort

THis show has reasonably high production values and it's not incoherent. However it plays like a young adult tv show, it's not immersive and the 'mystery' isn't compelling.I understand that Disney wanted this show to stand out for its diversity and to undermine some traditional star wars assumptions. But that just isn't interesting or original for most people and the show really needs more.In my mind, Star Wars hasn't worked without George Lucas. The mandalorian was ok early on, Rogue One was quite good and Stellan Skarsgard made Andor good.

" Half a minute!
",2024-06-06,"The Acolyte. It's been a while since I've watched anything from the new world of Star Wars. Half a minute is as far as I got into this thing, before I gave up. I was there as a ten year old back in 1977, when the advert for THE first Star Wars film came out. I was in the cinema to watch Disney's 'Bed-nobs and Broomsticks' or whatever it was, which I do recall was being promoted as a special effects extravaganza at the time and ... to cut a short story short, I don't recall anything about 'Bed-nobs and Broomsticks'. I spent the entire run-time thinking about the Star Wars advert I'd just seen, which, by the way, as a ten year old, I knew nothing about beforehand. When I finally saw Star Wars, I was blown away, like everyone else at the time. Here we are 45ish years later and ... half a minute was all I could bear. What the hell happened? I'll give it a go. The original Star Wars film was gritty, rough, dirty, un-polished, novel, different, everything that is so wonderful about the film industry, when it gets it right - which absolutely reflected the whole Star Wars story premise etc. With these spin-offs the writers go straight in there with the filmic equivalent of a polished, blinded-up, gold-leaf 'smart-phone' gadget thing and just because their shallow minds are deeply impressed with such shiny rubbish, they think the rest of us will like it too. Wrong. The Acolyte! Half a minute. Try taking a look at what happened with the MCU 'stuff', coz the same's happening with this stuff. As a ... oldish man now, I'm reminded of what British Leyland did to the British car industry ... we need a 'Chopper' not a 'Shopper'.

At least do your job and act. Why is the speech out of sync with your mouth, CGI alien?"" And then I kept watching and it didn't get much better.I get why all the hate is here. This snow isn't good, and it's not bad, it's just nothing. The characters? Soulless puppets, The plot? Can't really say after one episode but so far there is none. Can't even remember anything related to score, and I finished episode 1 like 10 minutes ago. The Actors? Felt like they picked random people off the street. I've seen better extras.

There is a reason why this show has gotten as much backlash as it has and I really hope that the higher ups take notice of this and work to put out better films and tv shows in the future.

The rest is hot garbage in all honesty.Massive plot holes just in the first part of the first episode.Inconsistencies all the time. Example - 'A Jedi only draws their light saber to kill', a bit later on - pulls out light saber to use it as a torch.Unnecessary exposition, constantly treating the audience like idiots.A fight sequence that flies in the face of everything we know about the Jedi i.e. A high ranking Jedi Master who can't use a force push to deal with a couple of daggers?A fire in a vacuum?An investigation that manages to not investigate whilst abandoning all logic and reason and arrests someone on the basis of one eye witness. Eye witnesses get things wrong all the time. Questioned yes, investigated yes, arrested No. A cursory glance at the ships log and journey times would have made innocence obvious but the laughable plot required an arrest so an arrest we got.The ship crash that the protagonist wakes up from with not a mark on her or a hair out of place - except that the ship would have been effectively a pile of dust having hit the planet like a meteor (out of control rock basically) - it would have caused a crater and massive destruction and no one would have survived.And it basically continues in that vein in part 2. I have heard part 3 is going to be worse - and I believe it on the basis on what I have already seen. I won't inflict on it on myself.Mostly the acting was wooden and stiff, might not be the fault of the actors, poor direction and bad writing are most probably the culprit. Appalling dialogue full of clichés and tropes. It was dull, uninspired, and tedious for the most part. Little of it fitted into the Star Wars Universe.

Hell yes it is, I've seen Star Wars Pinball machines that have a more robust plot.As I said, this is what I think happened,The Writers Room March 2023 one of the head writers just got a new laptop with Windows 11 on, so he thought he would give copilot a go. So he types;
""can you write a TV episode for a new Star Wars show, but is set hundreds of years before what people have scene already. You know the era that all Star Wars geeks want to see when the Jedi were totally all powerful.Make sure that we get loads of woke content though. We need a homosexual element, we need something about kids being not be who they think they should be.But make sure the Jedi, who for eons have fought for the light side of the force, make them morally questionable for this show.We need a few new character species, that we might be able to make in to toys""And the AI, responds after a few seconds with a rough outline for the show, the writer's response is ""can you dumb it down a little, so 5 year old kids will get it"" oh also make sure that it doesn't reference any other Star Wars content already in the public domain. We cannot make this new show off limits to non Star Wars people.Casting Choices
We need some people of colour
We need some Asian people
We need some recognisable people from other ""nerd"" shows, but we will hide them under makeup and masks so no one who will know who they are.Previous Acting Experience not required.Additional Note: Casting Director I watched a show on Netflix called squid game, I think it became quite a trending show, nothing as big as a Disney show, but a few people have seen it. See if you can get the main guy from it for our new show, I know he doesn't speak good English, but they have translators in the future (or is it in the past, who can keep up)so that won't be a problem. You might have to think of an excuse why he has got a crappy accent though.Additional Additonal note: To Mrs Kennedy, this new AI stuff could be a blueprint for all new Star Wars content, it looks great and I'm sure no one will notice. Then we won't have to pay Dave Filoni and the guy from Iron Man a fortune to look after George's legacy, I mean The Acolyte looks way better that season 1 of that show with the guy who doesn't take his helmet off, and Yoda's illegitimate offspring.We can do this without them no one will notice a difference between The Mandolorian and our new show.Then we make bank, none of the Star Wars fans would dare to criticise one of our shows !!!",4.0
" A Refreshing Addition to the Star Wars Universe
",2024-06-05,"I just finished watching the first two episodes of The Acolyte, and I have to say, it doesn't deserve the hate it's been receiving.After spending too much time on Twitter, I was fed up with the negative comments about literally anything new from that comes Disney Star Wars and decided to see for myself.The show is a breath of fresh air. None of the characters in the first two episodes have appeared in previous live-action shows or movies, which is a welcome change (at least to me).The show's substantial budget is evident. The CGI is impressive, and the acting ranges from decent to good. However, what truly stands out are the score and the visuals.The story is engaging and has hooked me enough to eagerly anticipate the next episodes.Many people have complained that the canon is broken because the prequels stated that the Sith are thought to be extinct. However, just because a character wields a red lightsaber doesn't mean they are a Sith. This has been established in other Star Wars media.I particularly enjoyed seeing the Barash Vow mentioned in live action. AFAIK, the Barash Vow had previously only been mentioned in comics and books, so its inclusion here was very satisfying.I had also read the Rolling Stones review which mentioned that Lee Jung-jae's English made some of the dialogue hard to follow or uninspired and I'm just sitting here thinking, if we live on one planet with millions of dialects and accents, why would anyone expect a show set in a huge universe to not have accents.TL;DR: The Acolyte offers a fresh story with intriguing characters set outside the familiar Skywalker timeline, featuring beautiful visuals, impressive CGI, and a stunning score.

The actors play their roles as effectively as they can and in no way are they responsible for the overall sense of the show, but the best actor can only be as effective as the writing and the directing.There are some serious flaws in the story telling in how events are supposed to come together and even the motives of a character for a major plot of the story.The fight scenes are moderately entertaining and is focused more on hand to hand combat than any lightsaber action.",3.0

" The only 1 Star review I ever gave
",2024-06-19,"From the opening crawl to the final credits, the latest Star Wars movie is a masterclass in cinematic failure. It's as if the filmmakers took everything that made the original trilogy iconic and systematically stripped it away, leaving behind a hollow shell devoid of charm, coherence, and any semblance of quality storytelling. The plot, if one can generously call it that, is a convoluted mess. Characters hop from one poorly designed planet to another without any clear motivation or purpose. It's as though the writers brainstormed plot points by throwing darts at a board covered in science fiction clichés. Not only is the story predictable, but it's also riddled with plot holes big enough to fly a Star Destroyer through. Speaking of characters, the new cast is entirely forgettable. The protagonists lack the charisma and depth that made Han, Luke, and Leia beloved icons. The villains are laughably underwhelming, devoid of menace or complexity. Even the cameos from original trilogy characters feel forced and devoid of any emotional weight, serving only to remind us of what once was. The special effects, usually a saving grace for Star Wars films, are surprisingly subpar. The CGI feels dated and overused, with action sequences that are more chaotic than thrilling. Instead of being immersed in a galaxy far, far away, I found myself distracted by how fake everything looked. As for the direction, it's a textbook example of how not to helm a blockbuster. The pacing is erratic, with scenes dragging on interminably or rushing through key moments without giving the audience time to care. The attempts at humor fall flat, and the dramatic moments are unintentionally comical. The score, traditionally a highlight of Star Wars films, is unremarkable at best. It recycles old themes without bringing anything new or memorable to the table. It's as if the composer was as disinterested in the film as the audience will be. In conclusion, this new Star Wars movie is a catastrophic disappointment. It fails on every conceivable level, from storytelling and character development to special effects and direction. If this is the future of the franchise, then it's time to let Star Wars become a distant memory rather than tarnish its legacy further with such abysmal entries.",1.0

They also have an underground sec in the jedi order of this time period. Basically, the story is not making a lot of sense. And you've already killed off three characters that can really add a lot to the story.

" not bad but not good. Boring
",2024-06-06,"The plot is very simple. The story is already known, many clichés. Everything is predictable, childish. It's the typical story of the search for a killer who eventually turns good and catches their mentor. I had high expectations for this series, but during the two episodes I watched, I was constantly checking how much longer they had left. A real shame since I'm a Star Wars fan and I didn't find that spirit. I hope I am pleasantly surprised and very wrong, although I highly doubt it. In two episodes, I already perfectly understood the outcome. It's a series that goes from point A to point Z..",3.0
" SW:TV always feels like ""this could easily be way better""
",2024-06-08,"I think the problem with SW:TV is the writers always feel pressured to make something so clever, it gets in its own way a lot. Many characters have potential huge moments but it doesn't get explored to hide some ""big secret"". My first example: Carrie Ann Moss vs Bad Twin. I feel like nearly none of the possible Kung Fu tropes were used which could have been entertaining were employed. When Bad Twin punches CAM's friends where is the part where CAM sweeps her robe up and shouts indignantly ""what is this insolence??"" Where is the super zoom into Bad Twins face saying ""I am the assassin here to murder you for your CRIME!"" The entire fight should have been twice as long and as it said in The Matrix ""you know a person by how they fight"". Bad Twin is dirty and raw, CAM is initially defensive and honorable. They should have had a lot more dialogue explaining what the crime supposedly is, and have CAM say ""your kung fu is worthy, who is your SIFU?"" I mean come on you need a line like that its a kung fu movie!Also show us what is so cool about mixing Jedi and Kung Fu. Maybe get to a part where Carrie's character gets super angry and outraged, she can't believe Bad Twin is able to get some shots on her and hurting her friends so now she goes into attack mode, force pushes herself to jump kick which gets blocked but she levitates and rains down blows blooding Bad Twin a lot. During the fight they talk to each other and slowly reveal a lot about the overarching plot through many punches and kicks. Give Carrie some last words not just slump over. If writers decided she did nothing, let Carrie say ""I swear, I did not murder ... that man"" then have some Asian style music as Bad Twin has a doubt about what she is doing.This is really what people are complaining about. You add female characters but they never get visibly hurt or damaged except for maybe a bloodless death! Its not that they are strong its that they have no flaws.My second and final point, is about the second Jedi, they should have went all in and literally showed the crime the Jedi actually did.Then we have one possibly fake untrue crime and one true crime keeping us on our toes. Say the writers go crazy and the Jedi is confirmed to having sexually abused younglings. Which they would sort of show, the Jedi disrobing a boy briefly, this makes the Star Wars Universe feel so raw and so real because their problems are also our problems. So now you root for Bad Twin to kill this Jedi. Now you want her to figure out the puzzle on how to kill him. Thereby going on an emotional rollercoaster not knowing exactly what to feel maybe being on Team Bad Twin. They forgot to allow us to root for Bad Twin.There could be other bad Jedi in future episodes as well. One Jedi uses her power to get rich by dealing Spice to Hutts, prostitution or something, its interesting seeing how Bad Twin kills each Jedi with no weapons. The fourth and final criminal Jedi is Our Hero and his crime will shock you and bring such a richness to the character you love him anyway.The show would have been so interesting, if it showed a Jedi Order in decay, criminality, and temptation through power eating away at peoples ethics and souls. The Sith isn't all bad, its a reaction to Jedi corruption. When being overly passive and apathetic brings disorder, the exact opposite reaction is The Sith and also brings its own evils.I don't see that in this show, therefore the point of the show is too muddled in ""secrets and mystery"" for us to really enjoy it. We don't see the point in the narrative and this causes it to be boring. The dialogue is too afraid to be funny or interesting so as to reveal too much. Good writing would be to give us funny, interesting, dark and unpalatable character decisions, along with mysteries under the surface. Make us feel emotions and the viewer will be enraptured.Its easy to make Star Wars cool, if you make what you knew before and add things to the delicious dish such as Kung Fu and raw criminal activities that need to be investigated, you only enhance what Star Wars is. So far, this task is a failure but in the right hands with just some care and understanding of basic tropes, would be an excellent show for fans and newbies alike. That is why we get more frustrated with Star Wars than any other series, its this sickening feeling of why doesn't anyone care to rewrite this one time to make it all worth it and worth 180 million dollars. Its senseless and so we cry out in exasperation once more with another Star Wars project.",4.0
" Star Wars....subverted
",2024-06-13,"I grew up watching and loving Star Wars. I enter into each new movie and series incredibly hopeful that I will like it, but end up largely disappointed. Quality storytelling has taken a backseat to heavy handed indoctrination. The classic mythology of Star Wars, the battle of good vs. Evil, has taken a back seat to moral relativism. Unfortunately, Kathy Kennedy is a poor steward of this franchise in the eyes of most Star Wars fans. It appears Bob Iger is unwilling to make a change, and this once proud franchise will eventually die not with a bang but a whimper. Every franchise owes some service to its core fans, and this one is gleefully giving its core audience the middle finger.",1.0

",2024-06-08,"This review is based strictly on the first 2 episodes since that is all we have so far. Mainly because I am not a fan of martial arts movies (except for Jackie Chan), I found this show dull, dragging out fight scenes needlessly.The storyline so far has been vague at best. Maybe that is intentional but this show actually put me to sleep, something that no other Star Wars show or movie has ever done and I have watched some of the originals more than 20 times.I have to agree with some others that the show seems tilted to a younger teen audience.

Maybe everyone will get non-great value outfits because currently they would not get a second look at a comicon/cosplay event.Picking on costumes and bad CGI isn't really all that nice, I would 100% believe that those who worked on it did as much as they could with what they had to work with. That is just why I wonder if they were given nothing.It is tough to fall into the trap that many shows are, sometimes rightfully, crucified for being agenda driven but this one feels a bit heavy handed simply because there was not much else to enjoy. I would say It is almost impossible to make a show that just focuses on nothing controversial, you would get no conflict, but the actual art of direction should be to make it woven seamlessly into a story. Plenty of the most famous shows/movies do it...this one does not so far.I cannot say if this show will get better or worse but I do know I am here for the long haul simply because the comments make me happy.",4.0

" Simply Lacklustre
",2024-06-15,"Sadly this series is just poor. The plot is littered with holes, any mysteries are obvious from a mile away and I don't care about any of the characters in the slightest. I would have loved to have seen a series about Carrie Ann Moss's character but (spoilers) she dies in the initial set up. It lacks charm, it lacks humour, it lacks excitement and it lacks intrigue. I appreciate that were are only three episodes in but the characterisation is paper thin. The role of one of the young jedis is to be constantly wrong about everything. Disney need to decide who its target audience is. Is it for kids (I would say not), is it for the adult fans of the original triliogy (as one I can say definitely not), is for the Disney era only fans? Who knows?

I've seen plenty of movies where the plot falls into line during the last act. 4 x hour long episodes would maybe have benefited this more (I could be wrong depending on how this actually pans out) but 4 episodes in and I'm hardly hooked.The mysterious 'Master' looks menacing. I get there's other Witches out there other than the Nightsisters (why wouldn't there be?). Was the singing necessary?Disappointing that all we got to see of the Wookie Jedi was him stumbling around his secluded retreat.As fans we're used to retconning but to change the lifespan of an entire species to get Ki-Adi Mundi in I find highly questionable.

" I want to like it, but it's not that good
",2024-06-18,"I want to applaud the director and Kathleen Kennedy for taking a chance to explore Star Wars outside the Skywalker timeline. This prequel series explores an unknown era with boundless possiblities. It has the potential for so much, but fails badly in every area. How is it possible for it to be this bad?I'm struggling to watch it, to connect with the characters, it feels so forced and the Jedi don't seem very likeable through the first three episodes. There isn't anything fun or enjoyable about this timeline and there's no reason for it, unlike Andor or Kenobi where the Empire have taken over everything and it's meant to be depressing and sad. You can feel it when you watch those series, but the Acolyte fails to connect with the audience.As a fan, I really enjoyed Ahsoka, Kenobi, and Andor. I had to rewatch Boba-Fett to like it better and the Mandalorian is Star Wars now. But this series is just not that likeable or believable. There is nothing new that is being unveiled, it's just rehashed plots from all of Star Wars. I don't like the way the Jedi are portrayed as a bunch of stiff lifeless monks. The plot of the entire show was revealed in episode 2, so now there are 6 more episodes of painful dialogue and rehashed plot points. And where is Master Yoda? Seems odd that there has been no reference to him yet. The show would have been better off being 1000 years before Episode 1, instead of 100. I also did not like the exaggerated martial arts moves that looked like bad wire work from a low budget Chinese movie. That's not Star Wars.I don't hate Star Wars and I try to be open minded for every movie and series, but the Acolyte is just not that good.

",2024-06-20,"Every time a new Star Wars story drops the usual suspects are quickly out of the traps to spill their bile irrespective of the quality of the production: I generally like the output but obviously some more than others: I try to never lose site of the fact that Star Wars always was intended as a sort of Saturday Morning kids matinee. Yet so many fans from those days are expecting deep thoughtful adult drama and it was never supposed to be that: That's not to say that the stories shouldn't appeal to adult's too as many films and books etc do.In that light I really want to like this but 4 episodes in it's a bit of a struggle. It's like going to Michelin Star restaurant and finding your meal hasn't been seasoned: it looks right but it tastes all wrong: The set design and production values are very much Star Wars, the opening scene with Carrie Ann Moss promises much for what is to follow. Unfortunately so far that was good as it gets.It's hard to know what the story is, there is no tension, no hints to keep you guessing, just a void of nothingness: Dialogue is clunky at best and at times just bafflingly banal. The acting is almost universally awful but I reserve judgment on whether that is down to the dire dialogue they have to deliver or whether they are genuine bad actors.

The acting is subpar, the direction is awkward, the visuals are ok, the sound is bad.At times it's like things happening randomly. For example, in a certain moment in the second episode, the Jedis rush in the temple suspecting that Master Torbin is in danger. Osa has something of a vision and takes a detour. All of a sudden, she arrives first (!!) in the murder scene, only for a ""it's not what it seems like"" moment to occur next. So the Jedi who led the group to Torbin's room didn't know which way was faster, or decided to take the long road when they were in a hurry...The Jedi are also a questionmark in this show. The action choreography is good but the Jedi are not martial artists. Sure they can use some melee, but not this way. We see some Matrix and Ip Man action going on and it doesn't feel right. The Jedi are inspired from Samurai.They also seem kinda stupid and they are always one step behind. Some may say that this was the case also in the prequels, but in the prequels they were blinded by their arrogance, not stupidity.Acting is also an issue. Most actors seem wooden. Amandla Stenberg is decent, Lee Jung-jae and Rebecca Henderson are ok, but the rest are not doing a good job so far.To conclude, the first two episodes by Leslye Headland were average at best and I had very low expectations.

The main character/characters are blandly written and very flatly played with no redeeming features that make me care about their back story or future. The entire cast could all walk on to a transport in episode 3 and be replaced and I would have the same level of attachment to an all new cast.Second, the Jedi are made to look like a group of disorganised teens with masters who are infighting and acting like teachers in a high school. There is no sense of structure, wisdom or control in this version of the order. With members of the order acting like everyday people, not highly trained (or being trained) force users.Third, the production value is poor at best, with sets, costumes and props looking like a Disney theme park attraction, not another world. The production team have missed the make by so much that you cannot engage in the reality of the worlds they're showing you.Four, the dialogue is cliche and predictable, with scenes so boring you can leave the room, come back and know exactly what you missed. The mystery of the main villain was ruined in the first episode and leaves you with no desire to care about who or what they are and why they are doing any of this.I truly hope the series improves, as its initial offering is well below what I have come to expect of modern Star Wars.

One of the things I love about the star wars saga is the clone wars, fall of the Republic and rise of the empire was largely down to our heroes, the Jedi order, failing due to their arrogance and over confidence that they knew everything when they were among the last to figure out what was going on.This story though, it has a whole bunch of proper face palm moments from just straight up clunky story with a ""twist"" that you'll probably see coming but may actually dismiss as a ""nah, that's to easy. Surely not...oh wow, that is it. Oh dear"" to the good ole straight out of Star Trek Discovery's play book ""we want this character to be really clever but lack that ability to write this character to be really clever so instead well make the dude standing next to them be thick as a box of rocks so character seems to be really clever"". Go watch Babylon 5 or The Expanse for tips on how to write strong and intelligent characters that don't need everyone dumbed down to show it.And if the writers thought they were doing it like Game of Thrones with one of the characters they kill off, Ned Stark worked because they gave us time to get to know him, for the character to earn our respect and for us to grow to like him. They set him up to practically be the main character before the big shock ""he ded"". What you've done here is with the actress you had in that role and how heavily that character was featured in all your promotion kind of left me going ""so...technically false advertising maybe?"". It wasn't shocking.

",2024-06-06,"Do not believe the h8ers. This is a great SW show filled with interesting characters and intriguing situations. Stellar cast. I loved the setting too: it happens way before Phantom Menace, so it is not beholden to Skywalker era continuity. Hopefully, we will get more series set in this and other eras. The show is particularly well made: great locations, sets, direction, editing. Andor is still the gold standard in these regards, but The Acolyte is close behind. Amandla Sternberg is a great focal point for the show. Daphne Keen shines in a thus far smaller role. Hopefully they will share some key scenes together. Lee Jung-jae and Carrie Anne Moss are the coolest Jedi Masters since Qui Gonn and Obi Wan. All told this is fabulously cool and fun, &highly recommended. .",10.0
" A down hill slope.
",2024-06-18,"For me The Acolyte started out strong, I thought the first 2 episodes were pretty decent give or take a couple scenes here and there, the cinematography, music and acting was fairly decent and it seemed like it could be an up hill slope to an increasingly good series. Sol is by far my favourite character giving off Qui-Gon Jinn vibes. I honestly felt people were way to harsh on the first 2 episodes and were nitpicking. Unfortunately it all came crashing with the series 3rd episode. The acting was extremely weak, the plot was strange as the characters are supposed to be witches but are using the force and not magic. Didn't really make sense why the Jedi would want children that are so old and also children that clearly have darkness within the,",3.0

The plot is paper thin and doesn't engage the viewer. I'm doubting if it's worth bothering to watch to the end. The actors in this look bored and uninterested in script, delivering line after line of this dribble with no enthusiasm for the material.

" A missed opportunity
",2024-06-25,"The Acolyte arrives with the promise of exploring new sectors of the Star Wars mythos. The series spins a new narrative around the Jedi and their connection to the Force, but the creativity sometimes breaks Star Wars canon. Ultimately, it may disappoint many long-time Star Wars fans.The show introduces us to a new ensemble of characters whose motivations and backstories have potential. However, the execution leaves these characters feeling one-dimensional, with their arcs seeming more like missed opportunities than exciting journeys.While The Acolyte presents a fresh perspective on the Jedi Order, the series' portrayal of the Force and its users strays into territory that might discomfort long-time fans, who could find the reinterpretation at odds with the established lore.Star Wars fans are ultimately an easy audience to please; they want light saber fights and explosions. Alas, the action sequences, while visually engaging, are sporadic and lack the necessary narrative to make them truly impactful.In conclusion, The Acolyte is a series that had the potential to be a bold exploration of the Force but ultimately may lose many long-time fans along the way.

" Attack me with all your incompetence and idiocy 🙈
",2024-06-06,"My wife and I grew up on Star Wars and so have our children. We've developed a very low threshold for Star Wars content since Disney bought it from George Lucas. Star Wars was never a controversial franchise until Disney bought it. We've enjoyed Andor, Mandolorian, Kenobi and even Ahsoka, the movies have continued to sadly disappoint, don't even mention The Rise (and death) of Skywalker!Life is hard enough and it shouldn't be too much to seek out some family friendly entertainment from a beloved franchise. Then came the Acolyte... I don't often leave bad reviews, but this almost demands a ZERO rating.I could care less about who someone loves or lives their lives, but if it's part of the story I expect it to be a part of the narrative, not the entire narrative. This is just a horribly written, horribly directed and horribly conceived story from start to finish. If Disney didn't have an AGENDA, I really doubt that they would've been eager to set fire to the Star Wars franchise.Social issues are important, but this was handled so poorly that it alienated nearly an entire fan base. I'm done with Disney Star Wars until they clean house and fire Kathleen Kennedy (destroyed Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchise), Dave Filoni, Leslie Headland and that delusional Amandla Stenberg.It's amazing that they could take one of the most iconic and successful franchises in the world and turn it into a total dumpster fire 🔥.",1.0

" Beyond disappointing
",2024-06-11,"First off, I have zero issues with any of the actors in this series. I blame the writers and producers for the shortcomings in ""The Acolyte."" For a series that has such a huge budget, it is amazing that old sci-fi shows like Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers, Star Trek Next Generation, and even Empire and Return of the Jedi look better than this.The writers seemingly have zero ability to write a compelling narrative or a consistent character. It's HORRIBLE. This is supposed to be, according to the show runner, a murder mystery. There is no mystery. The horrendous writing destroys anything that could be good with this series. Hollywood in general has devolved into telling people things that they should be showing people. Are all their writers recent college students? Do they have any life experience at all? Characters don't act in rational ways, they don't even act in a manner consistent with their character.It's always apparent when the writers are not familiar with the source material. Taunting a Jedi master to ""attack me with all your power"" demonstrates an almost laughable premise. No Jedi master EVER has attacked anyone in an unprovoked manner. The line may as well have been, ""come at me bro, come on!"" This isn't the actor's fault, this is a writing problem. I think the actors do a great job considering the script they've been given, but they've been given trash. Save your time and watch something else. If you are looking for complex, witty dialog and an entertaining show, ""this isn't the show you are looking for.""",1.0
" The force is not strong with this one sadly....
",2024-06-06,"Yes, there are many giving it a zero for absurd reasons. But as fans we all know the super toxic ones just rate everything zero.As for me, I watched the first two episodes and was left kinda of in the middle. The kung fu video just feels weird to have in Star Wars. And the wire work of one person early on in Episode 1 looked goofy, more meant for Hong Kong cinemas then Star Wars.Getting past that, some of the lines felt way to cheesy or like they were written by a kid. I guess I'm saying it was bad writing. Story wise its nothing to deep and seems like every other story we seen before. Jedi/Sith yadda yadda. Yes there is a some twists in this happening but it all felt bland.There is also an issue with them repeating the same dialogue over and over and over in various scenes. Like REALLY drilling home some things going on, as if the audience didn't get it the first few times. I kinda of looked away a few times because I was getting bored.Unlike something like Andor, which was mostly talking, but felt deep, you felt connected and involved.So far this shows definitely near the bottom for me for SW stuff. I'll stick around of course to give it a fair shot. If it improves, I'll change my review. For now though it's just a bit below average.",4.0

Not sure how anyone involved in this project can sleep at night, but I guess money over quality may have been the goal here.Basically the kids from Hogwarts can conjure up a Jedi very easily if they wanted to, a few goofy chants made up by a toddler and bam you have force sensitive children.

" This is really really bad.
",2024-06-10,"""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" had the potential to expand the Star Wars universe in intriguing new ways, but unfortunately, it falls far short of expectations. Despite the initial hype and the promise of exploring the dark side of the Force during the High Republic era, the series is a disappointing and muddled entry in the Star Wars saga.One of the most glaring issues with ""The Acolyte"" is its storyline. The narrative is convoluted and lacks a clear direction. It feels as though the writers were unsure of what kind of story they wanted to tell, leading to a series of disjointed episodes that fail to form a cohesive whole. The plot meanders aimlessly, introducing characters and subplots that are either irrelevant or underdeveloped. Key plot points are left hanging, and the resolution, if it can even be called that, is unsatisfying and rushed.The characters in ""The Acolyte"" are another major letdown. While the idea of exploring the perspective of Sith acolytes and their rise to power is intriguing, the execution is lackluster. The protagonists are bland and one-dimensional, making it difficult for viewers to become invested in their journeys. The main character, who should be a compelling anti-hero, comes across as whiny and indecisive rather than complex and conflicted. The supporting cast is similarly underwhelming, with most characters serving as little more than plot devices or background scenery.The dialogue in the series is another weak point. Much of the writing feels stilted and unnatural, with characters delivering lines that are either cliché or painfully expository. Instead of engaging in meaningful interactions, characters often resort to monologues that serve more to explain the plot than to develop their personalities or relationships. This lack of believable, dynamic dialogue further distances the audience from the story and its characters.Visually, ""The Acolyte"" is a mixed bag. While some of the special effects and set pieces are impressive, they are overshadowed by inconsistent quality and uninspired design choices. The series had the opportunity to showcase the High Republic era in all its glory, but instead, the settings often feel generic and lack the distinctiveness that has defined other Star Wars properties. There are moments where the show's budget constraints become glaringly apparent, with certain scenes looking cheap and unpolished.The pacing of the series is another significant problem. Episodes drag on with little happening, only to rush through crucial moments that should have been given more weight. This erratic pacing makes it difficult to stay engaged, as the slow parts are tedious and the fast parts are confusing. Important character developments and plot twists are glossed over, robbing them of their potential impact.One of the most disappointing aspects of ""The Acolyte"" is its failure to add meaningful lore to the Star Wars universe. Instead of deepening our understanding of the Sith and the dark side, the series relies on tired tropes and fails to introduce any new concepts that feel truly groundbreaking or thought-provoking. It's a missed opportunity to explore a fascinating period in Star Wars history with the depth and nuance it deserves.The show's score and sound design are passable but unremarkable. The music lacks the memorable themes that have made other Star Wars soundtracks iconic, and the sound effects, while serviceable, don't elevate the material. It's another area where ""The Acolyte"" could have shone but instead settles for mediocrity.In summary, ""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" is a disappointing addition to the Star Wars franchise. Its muddled storyline, unengaging characters, stilted dialogue, inconsistent visuals, erratic pacing, and lack of meaningful lore contributions make it a forgettable entry in a beloved saga. For fans hoping to see the dark side of the Force explored in a compelling and innovative way, this series is a significant letdown.",1.0

" Its not bad, but its not good.

The characters have surface level of depth and interest.Therefore, it must be the toxic fanbase. It must be the male fans, who won't accept change. It can't be any other reason, other than the fans.Or, perhaps its that Star Wars, at its core, has always been about a good story. Special effects were good, but the story is what carried it all. Add depth and development to the characters, and this is why it worked.Nope, must be the toxic fanbase. Not the fact that this series is slow, tries to be action packed, when the action is flat, and does little to make the characters interesting in the least. After two episodes, what are their names again?This story had a wonderful opportunity to set the time and place a long before all the known characters, and present us a time/space that was unique all to itself. So far, it doesn't do that. Its just someone killing someone, and an investigation and cat and mouse chase....oh wait a second. That's nearly every Star Wars TV Series so far, and a story cliché done over and over again.To be clear, toxic fanbase talk is nonsense. Give us a good story, with good characters, and you'll get a great response. Fans are eager to love the new Star Wars, but most of the creations have been lack-luster at best. Rogue One was excellent. Mandalorian S1 & S2 were perfect, S3 (jumped a shark). Book of Boba, started good and a wheel fell off. Kenobi, redeemed itself at the end. Asoka....space whales & witches? The story was decent, but had a bizzare and pointless resolution to the series. Andor, started slow and became really good. This one, two episodes in and I think I know one character name. Acting was one-dimensional (except for ""Jason"" from the Good Place), and, none of it engaging.But I digress. Two episodes in, and I'll likely try one more.

I have watched movies and tv shows for about 45 years and this is the worst I have ever seen. It's so unfortunate too because I thought the other Star Wars shows like Andor and The Mandalorian were great. But the acting in this one was so terrible. The writing felt like it was written by a 7 year old. There's just no plot. Nothing makes any logical sense. Scenes just insult your intelligence. Like a sustained fire on the outside of a ship - a campfire in space. Osha the lead character doesn't come across as believeable. Nor does her twin sister Mae also played by Amanda Stenberg. The poor child actors had zero abilities but you have to love how Mae as a child was able to burn down what looked like a fortress made of some sort of stone or titanium alloy. Osha also crash lands a space ship (out of control, damaged and no power) onto a frozen planet and sustains no injuries. You literally have to suspend belief as characters go traipsing through an obvious sound stage for no reason.

" This show is worse than a** from idiocracy
",2024-06-25,"I know, I know, a bold take (or maybe not), but if you just listen for a second it will become clear that the acolyte is greatly outperformed by a**.First, the amount of previous material that the creators of the Acolyte have access to in terms of the world building is enormous, whereas a** was the first of its kind, and had to do all of its world building by itself. The fact that a** clearly understands itself and its place in its universe to such a greater extent than the Acolyte is a major problem for the 180 million dollar TV show. The plot problems from this standpoint for the Acolyte are inexcusable.This is far from the only area The Acolyte is falling behind. A** outperforms the Acolyte in terms of the consistency of the message it is trying to send, which is unfortunate for the clear difference in production cost. A** definitively strikes a comedic tone that an audience can easily appreciate, whereas the Acolyte rarely, if ever, keeps the audience guessing in its effort to make a mystery. There is even an argument to be made that a** is more compelling in this regard. Despite being an obvious slapstick comedy, viewers are constantly thinking in the back of their mind, ""Who's a** is it?"" and, ""When will they just bite the bullet and go to the bathroom?"" These questions were obviously intentionally left up to the audience, likely to set up a sequel, A** Two: Return of the A**, or A** Two: Revenge of the Sh**, depending on which question the creators wanted to further probe. Compare this to The Acolyte where questions are answered almost as soon as they are given, and it becomes clear which piece of media has a greater overarching design.The Acolyte is still not over, and while I am deeply skeptical that they can levitate to the level of a film such as A**, there remains limited time.

" Very Mid
",2024-06-06,"Based on two episodes so far.Aggressively mediocre show with no highlights. As a spoiler-free fictional example: a character wants to make tea. Then you see them going through the motions. You may not know what they're doing next episode, but you always know the next few minutes, as the water starts to boil. There were a few deviations, but ultimately, they were just temporary distractions or setbacks. Characters set out to do the thing, then they do the thing. That made it feel somewhat boring to me, even though it is not slow paced per se. There are elements of adventure, and mystery, which were at the core of Star Wars, but the predictability here stops every momentum or intrigue and the characters are decidedly bland.As before in Disney Star Wars, characters are mostly boring. Everyone is stoic, and the evil characters have perhaps pent-up anger issues. Nobody is cocky, nobody is witty, nobody is wise, nobody is exuberant. They're all very mid, emotionally reserved, grey characters, without any edges. They find it important to show the young Jedi guy shirtless, which also signifies the intended target audience. This is no longer Star Wars, for a variety of reasons.The setting is entirely irrelevant (again). You can take pretty much any scene and have it take place somewhere else, and it wouldn't change anything. Needless to say, you cannot expect main Disney to actually expand the setting as Lucas' did seemingly effortlessly. There are no new things like trash compactors, turbolifts, cloud cities, walkers etc. That used to keep Star Wars exciting with each instalment. Andor and Rogue One are notable exceptions.Occasionally, there are good alien designs (also rare under Disney) that felt properly Star Wars-that specific mix of animalistic, gnarly or creepy and grotesque. However, the aliens of importance default again to being Star Trek aliens afflicted by the Roddenberry Gene. It's an unfortunate trend Lucas himself started in the prequels, and that is now an excuse to make every Jedi alien look like a cosplayer in cheap costume and makeup. Aliens are anyway somewhat rare to make room for more ""diverse"" human characters.Even though the streaming format should be the golden age of serial adventure blended with larger story arcs (as in Star Wars, original trilogy), Disney still hasn't figured it out. What remains is a very middle show you can skip, or watch in the background.",5.0

Well, it just all feels a bit off, the casting, the writing, the character development. It's all very amateur. Almost like someone had been set a high school assignment to write a screenplay for a Star Wars story, and ended up using ChatGPT to do it. Damn it's awful. Some of the dialogue almost feels forced, I just cannot take it seriously.Then there's the casting and characters themselves. The majority are just so unlikable, or better yet forgettable. With the exception of Indara and Sol, I cannot stand the rest. With Yord being possibly one of my least favourite Star Wars characters ever to grace our screens. And Mae being the most unconvincing Jedi Killer since that clone trooper took out Plo Koon during order 66.When Disney announced they were to be telling a new story set during the high republic era which will be a dark tale of Jedis being murdered, this is a million miles away from what was expected.

I'm a 55 year old woman who has loved Star Wars my entire life. I've watched every single movie and series, and try to give it a fair chance. I get Disney+ for free through one of my cc ""perks"" so why not? But in all honesty, The Acolyte is the worst crime against George Lucas' legacy I have ever seen to this day.It's like a high school English assignment where some teenager was forced to write a story set in the Star Wars universe, but they had never even heard of Star Wars before. The Acolyte is to Star Wars what Tina Belcher's Fan Fiction about zombie basketball players is to ""Lord of the Rings.""If you're REALLY a Star Wars fan and are thinking about watching The Acolyte, do so with the mindset that it's nothing more than one individual's FanFic. At least it may help lessen the rage over what some hacks have done to a beloved franchise.Full Review:
I *LOVE* Star Wars. I was 8 when it came out in 1977 at our local drive-in theater. I'm very lucky to be part of that once-in-a-lifetime experience! An honest to god cultural phenomenon.To say that there had *never* before been anything like that first Star Wars movie would be a colossal understatement. But then to also see The Empire Strikes Back when I was 11 years old just cemented the love of Star Wars into my very core. You have no idea how happy I am that NO ONE can take those experiences away from me.My love of Star Wars will endure until my dying breath. But my faith in any studio to make movies/shows accurately representing the archetypal Star Wars ""Hero's Journey"" ethos is disappearing, as all hope dies with each new series I watch. Yes, I still watch them. All. With the hope of finding another gem like Andor, or even the first two seasons of The Mandalorian.But The Acolyte? I can only hope that there is a special place in that Eternal Lake of Fire for whoever wrote and greenlit this epic pile of steaming bantha poodoo - and that's just for the sin of taking an absolute dump on nearly 50 years' of established lore and destroying the love and good will of true fans worldwide.",1.0

" Disappointing Exploration of Promising Premise
",2024-06-17,"""Acolyte,"" the much-anticipated addition to the Star Wars universe, falls short of its promise despite an intriguing premise. Set against the backdrop of the Sith Empire's rise, the series attempts to delve into the darker aspects of the Force and the intricate politics of power. However, what could have been a captivating exploration feels muddled and disjointed.One of the primary issues lies in the pacing and character development. The narrative jumps between different timelines and characters without allowing sufficient time for viewers to connect or understand their motivations. This results in a lack of emotional investment in the protagonists, making it challenging to root for their successes or failures.Furthermore, while the production values are undeniably high, with impressive set designs and visual effects typical of Star Wars productions, these technical achievements cannot compensate for a narrative that struggles to find its footing. The dialogue often feels forced, and pivotal plot points are either rushed through or overly convoluted, leaving audiences more confused than intrigued.Another significant drawback is the underutilization of its potentially rich themes. The exploration of the dark side of the Force and the complexities of Sith philosophy feels surface-level at best, failing to deliver the depth and nuance that fans of the franchise crave. Instead of a thought-provoking exploration, ""Acolyte"" opts for superficial spectacle over substance.In conclusion, while ""Acolyte"" had the potential to expand the Star Wars universe in exciting new directions, it ultimately fails to capitalize on its promising premise. With its disjointed storytelling, underdeveloped characters, and missed opportunities for meaningful exploration, the series struggles to engage viewers beyond its initial curiosity. For fans expecting a profound addition to the Star Wars saga, ""Acolyte"" may leave them wanting more.",1.0
" Star Wars in Name Only
",2024-06-16,"While Star Wars: The Acolyte promises an intriguing exploration of the dark side of the Force, it ultimately falls short of delivering a truly compelling narrative. Despite its ambitious premise, the series struggles to find its footing, with pacing issues and a lack of cohesive storytelling.One of the main drawbacks of the show is its uneven character development. While some characters are given depth and complexity, others feel underdeveloped and one-dimensional, making it difficult for viewers to fully invest in their arcs. This inconsistency in character writing detracts from the overall immersion of the series, leaving audiences feeling disconnected from the story.From the very beginning, it's evident that this series is more interested in pushing a feminist agenda than in telling a compelling story. Throughout the series, male characters are sidelined and intentionally overshadowed by their female counterparts, reduced to little more than background decoration or, worse yet, as mindless drones to be defeated by the seemingly invincible female protagonists. This shallow representation of male characters undermines the credibility of the narrative.Furthermore, The Acolyte seems intent on demonizing masculinity, presenting male characters as inherently flawed and morally bankrupt. Whether it's through their actions or their dialogue, male characters are consistently depicted as aggressive and emotionally stunted, perpetuating harmful stereotypes that have no place in modern storytelling.It is disappointing that The Acolyte had the potential to offer a nuanced exploration of gender dynamics within the Star Wars universe, but instead it squanders this opportunity in favor of shallow caricatures and one-dimensional portrayals that do a disservice to both male and female viewers alike.Overall, while Star Wars: The Acolyte has a few moments of intrigue and brief excitement, it fails to live up to the quality viewers expect from Star Wars or Disney. With its uneven pacing, shallow characterizations, and lack of originality, it's a disappointing addition to the Star Wars canon that leaves fans frustratingly unsatisfied.",1.0

Also, of course, they had to downplay the significance of Anakin Skywalker (only the most important character in the entire story, but sure).As much as I can see the potential with the force wielding women hiding in the massive structure on top of a mountain, it feels like a missed opportunity and I that the series creators were too busy figuring out how to impose their preachy agenda into Star Wars that they couldn't be bothered to realise just how weird the secluded lesbian space witches would seem.And yes, I cancelled my Disney+ subscription over this. An overreaction, some might say but it was just the straw that broke the camels back. Disney has done some really good stuff with Star Wars - and som REALLY terrible.

Them both being force sensitive and near each other and can't feel it at all, ""Oshie"" missing from 5 feet with a blaster, Master Torbin taking the vow because they couldn't save kids from a fire but had nothing to do with it? Then he just kills himself which is not the jedi way at all. Also, the twins were conceived by the force? Like Anakin aka DARTH VADER? And the witches are such a weaker version of the night sisters. And why would the jedi be on some remote planet in the outter rim and co.e to take the kids? They're just as old if not older then anakin was and Yoda, Mace, Ki Adi Mundi, and more all said NO to training Anakin and only got trained because Obi Wan threatened to leave and do it anyway.

The dialogue feels forced, the plot twists are predictable, and it completely lacks the depth and complexity that we expect from Star Wars.And let's talk about the casting - disastrous is putting it lightly. The actors seem miscast, struggling to bring their characters to life. It's as if they didn't understand the essence of the roles they were supposed to embody. In a franchise where iconic characters like Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader set such high standards, the casting in ""The Acolyte"" falls flat and fails to resonate.Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not usually one to blame everything on Disney, but thank you, Disney, for ruining Star Wars with this one. It's frustrating to see such a beloved universe mishandled like this. The decisions made in this show feel more like they're trying to cash in on the Star Wars name rather than honoring its legacy. As a fan, it's disappointing and disheartening.If they want to salvage this, they really need to step up their game. They should start by getting better writers on board - ones who understand the intricate lore and mythology of Star Wars, who can craft compelling narratives and meaningful character arcs. It's not rocket science; even a child could come up with more engaging storylines than what we're seeing here.Overall, ""The Acolyte"" has been a major disappointment for me and many others who cherish the Star Wars universe. We want to see stories that expand upon the rich tapestry of this galaxy far, far away, not ones that diminish it. Hopefully, Disney and the creators involved take this feedback seriously and make the necessary changes to deliver the quality storytelling that Star Wars fans deserve.",1.0
" Inconsistent with SW history, Telling instead of Showing
",2024-06-05,"After just re-watching top crème of the crop shows like Andor and Chernobyl, moving to this made the first two episodes a bit painful. It has potential but if the whole series is similar to the first two episodes, its will not compete with the likes of Andor and even The Mandalorian. Why? Not because of the popular reasons that most people gave.This show is completely relying on clunky, on-the-nose dialogue and overuse of exposition to describe stuff that you could simply use 5 second cut/flashbacks and really stiff acting. There was so much that was said that was just restating what we just saw or would have seen later. There is a place for lots of exposition and dialogue, but in this case it felt so out of place, unjustified and off-putting. Without giving away to much, they also had random scenes that characters did weird stuff that didn't feel consistent to the rest of Star Wars. Jedi don't gather in council together, but instead rush and keep stuff under wraps from each other, even thought they are in the peak of their peace keeping and unified balance??? There is also a scene where Jedi characters are standing cluelessly right outside a building, asking about an investigation, and the same force-sensitive antagonist is sneaking into the building simultaneously were-as in the Attack of the Clones, Obi-wan and Anakin sensed the danger of the two poisonous worms sneaking in through a window almost immediately, same as Luke sensing the pain Leia and Han would experience while training with Yoda. Seems weird that they wouldn't at least feel a disturbance in the force??? Plus even thought the Jedi Council didn't know the sith master was Palpatine, they still felt the disturbance and clouded vision his presence caused. Make it make sense. Also Lightsaber stabbings are no longer lethal according to Ashoka and Kenobi, Reva getting impaled by lightsabers TWICE by Vader in the chest and survives, but a one stick from a metal knife in the chest is immediately lethal after one time. Again MAKE IT MAKE SENSE.I'll update my review after seeing the rest of the series. Don't want to leave the review half-baked since I haven't seen the whole thing, but I'm less interested than before watching the first two episodes.",2.0

Fights are decent, graphics are good, set design is a little sterile (like all recent Disney projects - everything too perfect), costumes not bad. Sol's actor seems grounded. First ep 4.5/10Second episode - better by half! Decent pacing plot-wise, some twists and it's interesting yet slightly predictable... Could go either way!

Rebel Moon was an insane level of Star Wars wanna be garbage and it still managed to have characters and a story, and visuals, better than this nonsense. Some of the acting is good, some of it is god awful. I don't blame the actors, just whoever is directing them and not pushing them to be better or do better.Its so boring.

What we got was a totally mid experience all around.Writing was boring and predictable, but serviceable.Acting was ok in some parts (Amandla Stenberg and Jung-jae Lee were ok to good), but Charlie Barnette was awful, not sure why he is even there.Plot is extremely predictable and they do a reveal of the bad person in the first episode instead of keeping it a mystery which would have been decent story telling.Carrie-Ann Moss was wasted in her role. And the fight was totally unbelievable.The fire in space was just a comment on how poor our education system is that nobody who saw that thought about how dumb it was.The worst part is they ignore tons of lore about Jedi and how they work. There is no way the plot can work as presented if the writers know how the force works from the other movies or books.

The initial villain isn't even threatening. Pretty much loses every fight but somehow gets away with it.This show also demands you work hard to forget common sense, especially if you're a fan.Who plans to attack stronger opponents head on, knowing you're out powered and less skilled? The victories are hap hazard.Jedi knight letting fear influence him. Hello, what was the point of training someone from childhood if he's going to act like a rookie when in the field?

May as well have a sign in your hands saying ""we're watching you""Simple lore issues with dumb lines like ""The Jedi agree with me"" - you're all Jedi ; you mean the council or a superior agrees.Use of music is off.The direction is bad.Knowledge of the universe is poor. From the first Star Wars movie it's clear force users can sense each other. Not anymore. Multiple things like that, which fans will pick up on.Honestly ; this stinks of a school play, like it's on display and not a show or environment. The acting from some of the actors is almost like a tiktok skit at times, out of place in this universe, even the other Disney+ shows.Even the audio is bad, I'm no expert but I know to isolate a voice so you don't hear the room.Lee Jung-jae is great though . Very in place and I buy him as the character. Maybe it's the contrast to the bad acting, but even some of the smaller role characters you buy as living in the world as their characters far more than some of the leads who seem like that are acting in a tiktok skit. I'd love to see more of Lee Jung-Jae, even as this character, so I'm guessing he's going to die. I am guessing it will be a sacrifice, because that would be a cliche.Strip the Star Wars and this is bland and average at best , put it in Star Wars and you'll need your regular fans to work hard to like it.Looking into the media around this, it's not surprising how self-congratulatory the creators and talent are.

" I've realised the problem!
",2024-06-10,"The thing about Star Wars is that it was made with a teenage mind for adults - that was basically George Lucas at that time. As it developed, especially after the first three series, And became so famous, and made so much money, George Lucas tried to hone in on Teenage fantasies, but leaving behind the adults who made it famous in the first place when they went to see the original film.Now, the films and series are being made by adults, trying to think And imagine everything as a teenager, Therefore, missing the point of the original series. You make it for ""adults"" - not children or teenagers. When you do that, they will automatically tag along, so you have nothing to loose.It's mind-boggling that The studios have not realised this. And, it's mind-boggling that George Lucas went down that rabbit hole by making up silly childish aliens and storylines that become too unfathomable!They really need to get a grip!

" Worst of the Star Wars series
",2024-06-20,"I do feel like the Acolyte was not needed. Same with Andor and Obi-Wan. Ahsoka and Boba Fett are fairly engaging while Mandalorian is the best series so far but not as good as it was. I digress. The Acolyte has all the traits of an angst-ridden teenage soap opera and I can tell you how the future plot will play out. It starts with long lost two sisters one good and one bad. The good one aligns herself with the heroes and the bad one is brainwashed by an evil shadowy figure. The sister's paths cross again and through much emotional outpouring, they reconcile. The bad one comes over the the side of the heroes and they all unite to defeat the shadowy figure, who is unaware his padowan changed sides. To think The Acolyte cost $180 million.

The storyline is not engaging, the dialogues between characters is amateurish and there are idiosyncraties throughout the first two episodes. Fight scenes a la ""Matrix"" do not work or make sense in this universe. Staking out a suspect from a open balcony with binoculars (like a bad cop show) doesn't work either. The apothecary character is vaguely explained and leaves us wondering.....in fact there lies the problem with both first episodes, we are left wondering because too much is not explained. And to second what others have written, the cast is very young. This one is not for me.... I'm just waiting and hoping that the Andor showrunners will release another installment soon.",3.0
" Ok, but nothing special
",2024-06-06,"Honest Opinion:1. The budget must have been far less than what they spent on their other projects like Kenobi, Ahsoka, and Mandalorian, because the visuals look different than from those other shows-that or they used different equipment. I can see why some fans have criticized the series as a fan made film.Most likely Disney wasn't fully on board or the director couldn't get the same support as Filoni and Favreau.2. Story is decent. Not really unique, but enough to keep you interested.3. (Small Spoiler) They did a subtle reveal that the main female protagonist had two mothers, but I don't take that as a bad thing to throw in as it was subtle and not the focus of the story or really anything that defines the sexual nature of the female protagonist (as of yet anyway). I prefer if they do introduce same sex relations, that is subtle and doesn't overshadow the story.Final opinion for the series thus far:It's not the next Mandalorian or Ahsoka, but it's enough to just enjoy if you are looking to have something to tie you over until they release something better.",3.0
" Star Wars Has Become Such a Chore
",2024-06-12,"I've gone into all Disney Star Wars projects with an open mind. I was one of those fans saying, ""Wait for Ep VIII, maybe it'll all make sense"" back in 2015, and then ""Okay, that was pretty rough, but wait till it gets tied up in Ep IX"" in 2017. I've tried to find the good in the TV shows too, but it's been diminishing returns. At this point, keeping up with Star Wars is just a huge chore. With the exception of Season 1 of Mando and Season 1 of Andor, I haven't gotten any enjoyment out of it at all. I just do it out of rote obligation.This is definitely true for The Acolyte. At best, it's completely middle-of-the-road, utterly unremarkable fanfic. At worst, it's unwatchable. Episode 3 was the tipping point for me. Awful child acting, lore-breaking, agenda-driven story decisions, bizarre, cringe-inducing scenes. I never thought I'd get here, but I think I'm done with Star Wars. I'll watch season 2 of Andor for sure, but I don't think I'll bother with any new Star Wars content. I've been a fan of this series since I first saw the Original Trilogy at nine years of age in 1999, but it's just not worth the investment anymore. There is much better media out there.",5.0
" Such a bad take
",2024-06-20,"This is such a bad take...It disrespects its own characters. Trinity is the Trinity from the matrix. There's literally no difference between her character in the matrix and here. It destroys the immersion immediately. It shows the Jedi to be bumbling morons who are regularly disrespected by their subordinates. It's 100% the ""girlboss"" trope which frankly, everyone is extremely sick of... and the choreography is horrendous with no distinction between force moves and physical kicks. The Sith lord tells Osha the dumbest line in the show. ""The acolyte doesn't kill with a weapon."" After just killing a Jedi MASTER with a dagger and she CONTINUES murder attempts with the same weapons! It's shameful writing.It has reused Aliens and humans with makeup save a few new races, which are barely in the show. The writers have no concept of space operations (e.g., fire in space), travel (the moron Jedi think a girl blinked across the entire galaxy in a 12 hour period), and the main story arc of twins show 2 characters who happen to have the EXACT same hair style, color and length, which has to be one of the laziest jobs I have ever seen in a show... even B TV shows do better than that.There are no stakes. The Jedi master says her twin is dead. Then in the SAME episode tells her, ""I believe you."" referring her comment on her sister being alive. It looks like it's going to be a murder mystery, but it's revealed they're twins almost immediately. She kills 1 Jedi master by making him commit su*c*de with 3 sentences (only white male in the show kills himself, naturally after apologizing). The plot doesn't move forward naturally at all. A Jedi spaceship loses its target in DUST. DUST! Something it maneuvers through regularly on sand planets...This is the hottest part of this take. See the above and below. This is not fit to be a story for children.The action music is ""Matrix-y"" and honestly doesn't fit most scenes. The ambient music is fine, I guess and the SFX are decent, but really... that's an easy piece.HOW!? They're morons. A Jedi MASTER died because she couldn't do 2 things at once and one self-deleted after supposedly committing a heinous crime (contradicting a Jedi's master devotion to emotional control). All ANY Sith needs is a hostage to threaten while they make their move and they'll kill Jedi 100% of the time...I'm not sure what your point is here, but it reminded me of the first episode where the Jedi allowed a prison transport to contain an ""android(?)"" with implants that can hack the droid pilots... No one thought to check him? Disable his implants? Sedate him? Incompetence after utter incompetence from the ""protectors of peace and justice.""There are massive problems. This is a horrible show. How Disney is able to get away with releasing trash like this is beyond me... but I guess it's for people like you who don't see the sheer volume of inconsistencies, terrible tropes, bad writing, unrealistic (for the universe) physics, crappy choreography, terrible character designs, and ultra-predictable plotlines...SW is an utter embarrassment now.",1.0

" Supreme Disappointment
",2024-06-17,"The biggest disappointment in recent Star Wars memory. First I want to say it is not all terrible; but, even the good is overshadowed or forced out by the bad. As with all of the other recent star wars ventures, the visuals are great. I think a lot of the actors have even done well with the goofball script they were given... With that said, I cannot over look the massive issues with this show.Inconsistency. That is what star wars has come to be defined by in the Disney era. This, unfortunately, does not break that trend.Suspension of disbelief. When we watch a saga about space wizards and witches, FTL travel, and all manner of strange creatures, we happily suspend our disbelief in order to enjoy one of the greatest Sci Fi universes created in our era. This show has pushed my ability to suspend my disbelief past the breaking point.Killing off a charachter in the first few minutes of the show? I'll give you bold. But also foolish. You killed off one of the charachters people were looking forward to the most. Why would we watch? To find out why? Sure. But then you tell us nearly right away? Where is the mystery?A Jedi Master gets defeated by a newbie with throwing daggers? So in Ahsoka, Sabine was impaled by a light saber and was no worse for wear after a nap and some treatment. Reva was impaled twice in Obi Wan Kenobi. Still kicking. A Jedi Master gets hit with a small dagger center mass and immediately dies? Can we get an explanation? Maybe poison daggers? That would at least explain it.Everything is flammable. I was not entirely bothered by a fire in space. Maybe it was an oxygen line that was ruptured? Sure... It wasn't just there to show she had a bad history with fire... In episode 3 however, Mae burns down a STONE fortress with basically a broken lantern? How? And the fortress collapses off screen but only where people are standing? Then Sol, Jedi Master, grabs her just before she falls instead of protecting/catching her with the force? I mean isn't the force the point? Okay don't want to abuse it I get it. But then why hand a child your light saber like it is a toy or trinket. Then he saves Osha and gets her out of the burning fortress (almost nothing is on fire except rocks) and Osha needs a ventilator? But she is fine? Inconsistency.The writing is awful. I dont want to be mean but this is the type of stuff me and my friends would have made in middle school with our parents camcorder, hasbro sabers, and old curtains. The dialogue is hokey and feels forced. The situations and how they are resolved are ridiculous. Osha trusts the Jedi with her life to do the right thing but after crash landing on a frozen inhospitable planet (and being absolutly fine) decides to now run from the Jedi trying to save her? Where is she going? Mae seems more like a teen that didnt get what she wanted than a vengeful force user trying to kill the Jedi that wronged her. I have never been less intimidated or impressed with a Star Wars villain. Then a Jedi Master kills himself because he feels guilty? Guilty for what? Testing a kid for force sensitivity? Hopefully this is explored further. Yord seems to exist solely to get outsmarted and antagonized by a Padawan. The Padawan (girl from a X-Men movie I never watched but people really liked) seems to exist just to dunk on the vain Jedi Knight. And what was with that scene? Just to show off his body? No one wants to see Jedi performing menial tasks like steaming their uniform, gassing their speeder, or taking a dump. Again, the whole scene seems like it is just there for everyone to dunk on him. What a waste of screen time. Star Wars has had great stories of Jedi Knights brought low by their flaws and character defects (Vader, Dooku) so I am not opposed to Jedi with flaws. But this is how you implement it? Hopefully Yord gets some development to become something more than the dumb Jedi Knight more obsessed with his uniform than the mission. The witch coven plot line seemed off the rails to me. The chanting dance thing made me feel embarrassed for them just watching it. And they are supposed to be outcast witches who use dark power to create life? But Jedi show up and it is all chill? Let them examine the kids and what not? And the kid who wants to leave with the evil Jedi can just go? Mae tries to murder Osha then like all is forgiven 2 minutes later when they meet in the broken bridge?Some good points... I actually liked when Yord pulled out his saber to light his path. Kind of a fun nod to the video games where Cal uses his saber in dark areas (lots of people seemed to complain about this). I get the saber color argument but don't really care. Look up the colors and their meaning if you don't know. I think Amandla Stenberg has done a good job portraying two characters with different motives and emotions, even with the awful writing. Lee Jung-jae has done a great job at portraying a wise jedi master. I do hope we get more Sol in the future. I would watch a show or movie about Sol any day. Just get some better writng please. Carrie-Anne Moss did a good job as well, even if she now has no future in Star Wars. The CGI looks amazing. I would expect nothing less from Star Wars. And for only 3 episodes, we have had a good variety of planets, scenery and, locations.Overall, watch for yourself if you want to. If you liked this show... I am glad and can't take that away from you. I just hope that it improves or this serves as the wake up call for Disney to pull their heads out of their rears and start making quality Star Wars again with the goal of making quality Star Wars content and nothing else.",2.0
" Wasted Potential
",2024-06-17,"So far this series has been a big let down.I'll be nice and start with the decent stuff; visually it looks pretty good and is in line with what I've come to expect from Disney and the big budgets they spend. The acting is OK too, little on the robotic side but I think that has more to do with writing than anything else. Fight scenes have been meh - fights look more like a Hong Kong action film with suspension wires and Kung Fu than Star Wars. Disney really needs to dig up that choreographer from Revenge of the Sith.The writing is where this series falls apart so far. So many plot holes and things that don't make any sense. I know its Sci-fi / Fantasy and we need to suspend our disbelief but the writers have to at least help us understand things a bit. Episode 3 was terrible. Spoiler Alert - how does a fortress made of literal stone burn down? Even my 11yo got hung up on that. Oh, and I hate the way they killed off Carrie-Anne Moss in the first few minutes of the series. Like what? Why bring in a bad ass Jedi version of Trinity from the Matrix and kill her off with a throwing dart? Lame and wasted potential - I guess that's the theme of The Acolyte.",2.0
" Star Wars needs to figure out what it's doing and where it's going.
",2024-06-17,"The acolyte captures a snapshot of Star Wars as it stands in this moment. In a word: incomprehensibleIt is incomprehensible how so much money was spent on something so unremarkable. The costumes are not worth noting (the same beige drab jedi have worn since obi wan first strode out of the desert). The environments all appear samey and woodlandly (frequently specifically a single room of a single nondescript bar or temple) and certainly lack the kind of pizazz that would explain the money spent. The action sequences are camp and wash over and away from the viewer leaving not a single impression other than bringing the whole experience closer to a merciful credits-roll.It is incomprehensible how the writing reeks of amateur inexperience from the single largest and most powerful entertainment studio on earth. Cause and Effect are thrown out the window. Powers are displayed by characters (i.e. Mind read/force-save-from-a-fall) that raise questions as to why those same powers were not later employed when the stakes were much higher and they would safely resolve concerns the same characters are facing. Decisions are being made by characters that contradict earlier decisions wholly to push the plot events forward (i.e. Sol is told to pursue Mae/Osha without stopping by coruscant for the interest of time in one instance but later, when the same facts are on the table, he is told to return to coruscant and discuss what to do). The whole thing feels like a series of events stapled together without thought for how or why--an error to grasp the fundamentals of writing that stinks of limited editing, limited attention to detail, and lack of talent (which would be frustrating from a college student production but is inexcusable from this studio).And finally--it is incomprehensible that Disney would trot out the same, exhausted PR strategies with this series as they have been doing for near a decade. It is staggering to hear Disney make the claim that the only, or even the largest, motivating factor anyone would have for criticizing their latest star wars slop fed through their sewer pipe of a streaming service, is that the fans musts be morally reprehensible. If you don't like the Acolyte, there's something wrong or hateful or small minded of you. This is absurd. It's literally been made the butt of an entire south park episode. And maybe even most painful of all to admit is that--ten years ago when it was first thrown out there--I ate it up. I defended Captain Marvel, I defended Black Panther 1--heck I initially defended Force Awakens (emphasis on initially) by regurgitating the same rhetoric they force fed me and so many other people about a hateful fan base just unwilling to accept change. But the truth is, as nothing has changed, I look back on what I said and the untruths I bought and cringe at it. This show is bad. The writing is bad. It's honestly a disservice to the disenfranchised communities Disney says the fans are attacking for Disney to make a shield of them all while relegating them to a background scene for a split second the Rise of Skywalker (remember the two women kissing in the end of that film that was removed from the Chinese release?), or to shrink their position in the promotional poster and make them a clown character in the series (remember Fin being made smaller for posters of Force Awakens circulated, again, in China?). Disney does not care about the same communities it says the fans are attacking by pointing out clear and present flaws in the shows they are producing. Disney has made a mockery of the very same arguments they have bandied around these long ten years. And frankly, it's incomprehensible that we are expected to buy it again and again.The acolyte is bad. It's under thought out. Way over budget. And wholly without meaningful characters, constructed on flimsy plot, stretched across paper thin world building, and gives us a confusing buffet selection of underbaked themes. More than that though, it's a snapshot of Star Wars as it stands under the Disney stewardship. The method isn't working. The shows should not be this terrible when so many resources were made available to them. And it's just so exhausting to hear it's the world's fault, not Disney's, when their lame fart of a show limps its way across our screens. At least for the few episodes anyone cares to watch.",1.0

",2024-06-14,"The budget for this show was $10 Million more than the budget for Dune 2 and this is what you produced? It's basically generic Matrix Riverdale in space. People deserve their month's subscription price back. This company deserves its downfall as sad as it is to say. Time to jump ship if you're still holding on. Flat acting, dirt cheap writing, and the whole thing feels more like a student project from a student with a wealthy family more than it felt like a major studio production. Disney will do everything they can to spin this as a win but they have their work cut out for them because this seems like a larger cultural failure than Last Jedi.",1.0
" Star Wars Lost It Long Time Ago, in a Galaxy Far, Far Away
",2024-06-23,"As a veteran fan, and fully aware that this has nothing to do with anything but that THE ACOLYTE, so far, has nothing to do with the Star Wats Universe I grew up with.I had to see ""remastered"" versions trying to avoid that HAN SHOOT FIRST, the Wampa was more frightening when it was not evidently viewable and the Sarlaac Pit was nothing more than a big hole... but the magic wasn't untarnished.I had to get along with Anakin's failed love quest that turned him to the Dark Side mostly from immaturity and ignorance than from his lust for power, changing entirely the ""fallen hero"" that redeemed himself rescuing his son from the Emperor.And I had to watch the failure in three episodes to fulfill a Canon story that clearly takes ideas from the Graphic Novels, just to end in Rei Skywalker/Palpatine's scene staring at the sun.And I watched with my kid how CLONE WARS and STAR WARS REBELS tried hard to redirect the course... and THE BAD BATCH in a hurried-up end that was not justified for such an interesting story.But now, looking back, I do believe that STAR WARS lost it a long time ago, trying to sell the same story once and again, changing little details to avoid copyright issues and to admit that the Expanded Universe did it better at the time; forcing us in the view of people that I'm sure know little or nothing abot this amazing universe.By creating weak characters, the synergy and involvement of the audience is incredibly limited; furthermore, special effects cannot be the single feature, you need a RICH and INTERESTING story to catch the audience. These are the main flaws of THE ACOLYTE: bad writing, bad acting, no synergy, no involvement... no thrill.Unfortunately, the evident ignorance on the Star Wars universe, the narrow view on how to approach an entertaning story and the ""profit over quality"" principle that has been applied to this series makes me say...

I could probably spend hours discussing how terrible this show actually is but honestly, I'm just so bored And I think I've got to the point where I'm checked out completely with Star Wars now. This show has everything going against it. The acting is wooden and the line delivery unbelievable. The dialogue itself just isn't natural and feels forced. There's even a hint of rings of power in there , with dialogue meant to sound deep and meaningful that actually just comes across as uneducated. The stunts and fight scenes have some truly awful choreography which feels unnatural and you can almost see how the actors are flying across the room on wires.

The first show about the Sith perspective, but the product that we receive years after doesn't live up to that expectation.The writing is weak, with the characters been stupid just to create drama that is resolved 5 min later.Like the Jedi putting a prisoner in different ship, that crashes because a prisoner escape then everyone is capture not even 5 minutes later.The acting is okay for some characters but in 2 episodes nobody is likable enough for me to care. And both episodes don't terminate in any way that makes me feel ""I need to watch the next one now"".I had hoped that this show was more on the level of Andor, but is closer to Book of boba fett.

" I really wanted to love this. After all, I loved Russian Doll
",2024-06-05,"How can I put it? This does not feel like Star Wars in any way, shape, form, or fashion. What it does feel like it's a very high budget fan film. I just finished the first two episodes and cannot tell you how bland, boring, and poorly acted this is. I am not a hater of the showrunner at all. I am not a Disney Star Wars hater. I don't hate Kathleen Kennedy. In fact, I was rooting for this show to prove all the haters wrong because it is just ridiculous to be so vehemently opposed to something because of the obvious bias against the showrunner. That being said, this is as bad or worse than Kenobi, The Book of Boba Fett, The Last Jedi, The Rise of Skywalker, Resistance, The Ewoks films, and yes, even as bad as The Holiday Special. When the showrunner gives her wife such a prominent role, and she is literally the worst actor possibly in all of the history of Star Wars, then you realize rather quickly that there is no care given to even the most basic of filmmaking principles. Both episodes were so amateurishly produced on so many levels. I'm shocked this is so bad.I'm rambling. This is a huge stain on the franchise and if the rumors about episode 3 are true then this might actually be the thing that pushes the fan base over the deep end. It's time to put people in charge that understand this franchise. John Knoll, perhaps? Rogue One is the very best we've gotten in the nine years since The Force Awakens and there hasn't been anything quite as good since. No, not even the Mandolorian nor Andor.

Rogue One was OK until you watched it a couple of more times and then it really clicked.I think we have seen in the first two episodes that Jedi Master Sol is hopefully going to pull off some spectacular Yoda-ish fight moves so think before everyone rushes to suggest this isn't Star Wars they should wait and have patience.The beauty of expanding the Star Wars universe is that different stories will appeal to different people.,10.0

So far, three episodes have been released, and I just want to erase from my memory what I've seen. Everything from the acting to certain moments in the story looks ridiculous.

" Conflicted... (I guess spoilers?)
",2024-06-08,"I'm going to put spoilers though a good part of this review is going to be discussing what happens immediately in this show, the opening fight between Trinity and Mae.There is also spoilers for Kill Bill if you've not seen it.I'm all for a good homage to other properties when done well, but there was something glaring at me from this opening scene. At one point when Mae meets jedi Trinity, she says the line ""We have unfinished business"" immediately followed by, ""Attack me with all your strength"". What follows is a fight between the Trinity and Mae in a two floor food and drink establishment (not a bar), beginning with 'hench men' of sort (just a few people eating with Trinity) that progresses from the first floor to the second, with twists and turns in the fight, ending in a sudden ""surprise"" death.The reason I explained this all in detail is that most of it is directly taken from Kill Bill vol 1 & 2, with the most recognizable lines and effects being repeated almost identically. The Bride says ""You and I have unfinished business"" to Bill right at a pivotal moment. Similarly, The Bride says ""Attack me with all of your strength"" to O-Ren right before a pivotal moment.The fight is like a truncated version of the 'Showdown at the House of Blue Leaves' multi-fight floor, with several shots lifted which were almost the same.Afterward this one fight, I searched Kill Bill+The Acolyte and found the showrunner calling it ""Frozen meets Kill Bill"". It felt more like ""Star Wars steals directly from Kill Bill"".Yes, I do know that the Kill Bill fight scene was a send up of many great martial arts movies, including Jackie Chans Legend of the Drunken Master, Bruce Lee, and others, but it had originality.It felt weak and lazy and insulting in more ways than just that. Jedi Trinity could have used her force powers far better, but the jedi forgetting they have force powers is nothing new.The next thing we see is a knockoff BD-1.The show looks like it has a higher budget than some other recent Star Wars properties. I didnt find the acting very impressive. Theres a ""gonk"" droid 100 years before Anakin was space-jesus'ed into existence. I guess Star Wars technology hit a specific point then there was never need for upgrades.Its nice to see a few new species but they're basically window dressing.

" Ruins Anakin's story
",2024-06-14,"Despite what everyone says online about how Star Wars fans just hate everything Disney does, this isn't true or at the bare minimum it isn't true for me, I enjoyed many Disney projects, rogue 1 was great, I thought many episodes of ahsoka were amazing, andor wasn't bad, rebels had some good moments, even kenobi I thought had some great moments despite the original script being way better. Now that I've praised some of Disney's projects, I now need to explain why I will no longer consider myself a fan of a franchise I loved and grew up with.The acolyte. I don't even really know where to start with this review, going into the series I was surprised to say the least by the opinions that the actors held, but they are entitled to their opinions and I still went into this project with an open mind because I can't hold their opinions against the franchise. So now episodes 1-2, I thought both of these episodes were kinda mid, nothing really stands out to me. I liked Sol a lot and I thought he was a pretty cool character, he reminds me a lot of Qui-Gon. Other than that Osha was a little interesting, the effects and scenery looks great, and that was kind of it. They killed off some Jedi that I never even really got the time to get attached to or care about so that was ehh. Mae has some cringy dialogue, but other than that the first 2 episodes were just boring, I wouldn't even dock the show for that the first 2 episodes of a show are supposed to be setup. The problem lies with episode 3.Now for the part everyone is talking about, I had no problem with the fact there were a bunch of lesbian witches, the part that does seem odd to me is that the Jedi had such a problem with it despite there being the night sisters as witches as well. But that's not even the bad part, these witches created osha and Mae using the force. These witches who use a watered down version of the dark side, can do something that the lord of the sith plagueis and palpatine couldn't figure out, not only that, but the whole reason that anakin was created by the force is because of plagueis trying to create force sensitive life using the force. So if these witches have been creating force sensitive life all this time using the force then it completely gets rid of anakins importance being created to stop palpatine. This whole storyline of the witches says not only have we been creating force sensitive life using the force, but it is common practice for us, which is the whole reason anakin was made by the force itself, was to stop this abuse of the force. Disney could have made these witches lesbian and explained it as that's how their species works, they can reproduce with only women, but they intentionally made them use the force to create life and hint at their not being a father, to make anakin less important.",1.0
" Andor may of set the bar too high but cmon.
",2024-06-06,"This is really depressing.There was a period of time where I genuinely thought Disney were gonna turn it all around again. X-Men 97 is fantastic, Doctor Who is good. There's a new Star Wars series set in the old republic era, a setting which has proven to ripe with great storytelling in the Knights of the Old Republic games. It was some way into the first episode of the Acolyte that I realised I was being a naive idiot.The show has the same problems as Ahsoka, Kenobi, Book of Boba Fett and the third season of Mandalorian. It's got no real passion or real spark to it. Even the Sequel Trilogy as divisive as it was, at least had creativity to it. The show is a mystery thriller, except it reveals its mystery in the very first episode.The protagonist Osha has an evil twin Mae who's been killing Jedi though in ignoble fashion. In a slightly better show, we'd get this twist towards the end while being suspicious of Osha throughout. But since it's revealed so early on, the dramatic momentum just isn't there. There's a similar twist in Knights of the Old Republic and it's fantastically handled there.I feel bad for Leslye Headland, looking over the development which was pitched back in 2020 she clearly had investment and wanted something that appealed to old and new fans and both genders.I am genuinely happy Star Wars has more female fans, it always did but giving little girls someone to dress up as is something that should be applauded, not spat at by man babies.However just having diverse cast isn't enough to make up for a mediocre story and bad dialogue. Mando Seasons 1 & 2, Visions and Andor all show Star Wars can be just as thrilling and compelling as it was in the 70s and 80s. This series just takes the worst of Dave Filoni Star Wars mixed with CW level production.People don't want stuff that's just okay anymore, they want something that doesn't treat them like pigs to a trough.Also probably not a good idea to kill off Carrie-Anne Moss in the opening scene when she was a major selling point.",5.0
" Right idea, wrong execution (as usual)
",2024-06-20,"Disney have done it again. They can't seem to understand that grating a whole block of Disney-flavoured cheese over poor writing, awkward acting and early 90's cinematography is not a recipe for success.Rogue One and the first season of The Madalorian look amazing by comparison to everything else that Disney has produced since buying Star Wars from Lucas. Having said that, even they could've been a lot better. They at least felt like Star Wars but the rest are a really jarring mix of good ideas and painfully cheesy moments that instantly take you out of the story. It's as if there are real Star Wars fans making these things and then some Disney exec walks in and says something like ""We've got warehouses full of these weird, Penguin-looking things that we need to get rid of. Put them in the film so kids will buy them at Christmas.""If Disney stopped getting so involved and just left the decisions to people who actually care about Star Wars they could make a killing off the franchise and actually earn back a little respect.

I'm three episodes in, and still don't understand: What exactly is the point of this series? Why do I care about these two young girls/women, Osha and Mae?Now granted, you can have a series that's mainly characters just going on fun adventures (e.g. Mandalorian seasons 1-2), but you're not getting fun or interesting action/adventure here and you're not getting anything compelling in terms of character development or world building.If anything, the world building that they engage in is detrimental or bizarre (think prequel bad). For instance, there's now a few instances where the Jedi, mind you of the Republic, come off as bullies and possible kidnappers in a way.Additionally, the writing is awful and nonsensical. That's not to say it needs to be complex or anything; you can have simple, straightforward writing as long as it makes sense, but we get so many moments in this series that are cringe and/or head scratching.They did an episode 3 where, I'll give them credit, they at least made an attempt to do character building and give a backstory, but it was so cringe worthy, nonsensical, and weird that it was just completely off-putting and made me lose hope for this series. I don't think it can be salvaged.Also how did this possibly cost $180M to make? It seems like it was made for a fraction of that.I think Disney thought that they could do a star wars series where they crammed a bunch of Jedi and force users with lightsabers into it, slap a half hearted script on it, put a few well known actors in it (Lee Jung-jae and Carrie Ann Moss) and thought we as fans would just eat it up. Well it didn't work.

Don't get me wrong, I love me some Cobra Kai and think it is fantastic for what it is and supposed to be.However this is a Star Wars show and it seems that everyone forgot that a Master Jedi is not driven by their emotions and carries themself in such a way. The Jedi in this series would have all fallen to the dark side by now with the amount of emotional duress they exhibit. This is the Disney way not the Jedi way.The lead character acceptable and does a fine job. However, the dialog and motivation for the Jedi characters in this show are so far removed from the Jedi code it is cringe worthy at times.",4.0
" Best Jedi backstory in 2024!
",2024-06-10,"I've waited since I was a little kid for a Star Wars Jedi backstory. Now it's finally here . It's all making sense of how the Jedi used to be the gaurdians of peace before order 66 , the dark times and before the empire started and before Anikan skywalker was born. OSHA is by far not so bad . But her twin sister is a bigger threat to the Jedi . The twin is being trained by the Sith Lord . Who ever this Sith Lord is i hope to find out who it is . I'm hoping it's darth plagues the wise or someone far more powerful than sidious Vader and kylo ren . I hope in the next episodes I see more of Corasuant and tatooni . And the beginning of the Droid army .",10.0
" There is no need for this story!
",2024-06-19,"It's not good.Just imagine you have a galaxy full of stories to choose from and you somehow convince everyone including yourself that this is the one to tell. That this is the story that has to be told and that it will be a worthy addition to the saga. Come on, really?So many people, money and effort is put in just a really mediocre storyline. This is poor storytelling with annoyingly unnecessary characters. It feels very forced!What's the rush to produce new shows so quickly?Yeah I know, people, planning, production and money.Let us the viewer wait one or two years longer and use that saved budget and time to get amazing writers, actors and directors, and simply blow our hats off with something that is Star Wars worthy, why not...!?",5.0
" Mediocre-nothing more, nothing less
",2024-06-17,"While the show is not the best throughout its first three episodes, I find the sheer hatred of the show largely undeserved. The show itself is nothing special, if I'm honest it is far worse than the most recent Star Wars content. But I still found it moderately enjoyable. I simply do not see it as the worst thing ever, which seems to be the common opinion. The story does leave much to be desired, but there are a good bit of enjoyable moments, the dialogue while not great is largely bearable. The third episode, is actually my favorite the far, I know that it is the most disliked but I did not see any more problems with it than were in the previous episodes. It had about the same amount of problems as the other episodes in fact, but the story it was attempting to tell was much better. Overall the show is mediocre thus far. It is not very good, but I still found it to be a semi-enjoyable watch. I'll admit, the show deserves some disrespect for the currently quality with the purported budget, and for it being bad for stars wars standards. But these issues do not affect my overall opinions on the show. I have seen far worse shows receive ratings two stars higher than this one. Lot of people are complaining that the show doesn't feel like normal Star Wars show, but I am not sure that it is not meant to. It takes place during a completely different time than anything else in the universe. I also have no problems with the witches in episode three, it makes perfect sense that they would exist as there are already known witches in Stars Wars cannon. Frankly the show is much better than people make it out to be, it isn't good, but it could certainly be worse.",5.0
" Another fast-food, quick profit Disney Wars show
",2024-06-21,"First off, it's not a terrible show in comparison to say the show about the GEICO cavemen. It's got lots of flashy battles and ""whodunnit"" content, enough to keep your attention Sunday night while eating a tv dinner and zoning out.That being said, it suffers from most Disney productions. It really feels like a college fan film. Terrible CGI despite high production costs (that Blue Screen thing they use has to go). Terrible costume designs that look like someone cosplaying star wars. A meandering (and entirely predictable) plotline involving twins, lesbian space witches (their words), and a bunch of shady organizations chasing each other in circles looking for a clue to discover a modern evil created by evil actions in the past. Are the Jedi behind it? Are the sith behind it? Is some new force greater than both behind it?Who cares? The story is bland and visuals are meh. I slogged through the first two episodes and left with zero desire to watch it or anything star wars ever again. I wasn't mad or anything, it just wasn't entertaining.Long story short: college star wars fan fiction turned into web series despite hundreds of millions on production cost all to push the same basic Disney story as every movie:Adults are out of touch and children are the real heroes.",4.0
" They are trying to make a cash cow. Shame.
",2024-06-13,"Are the writers unqualified or being held hostage on creativity? Some explanation on how the force can be used should be tied into the original series. The series shows no interest in connecting dots based on the books/comics. Actors who don't even know their roles or lore. Actors used to study roles for months. Who is driving the boat? I never thought I'd write a review on Star Wars but this show made me go out my way to copy and paste my confusion on the show. What ever happened to sticking to lore or creating NEW and individual content? To release series based on lore and what fans want to see. For example, everyone liked Mando and Boba doesn't mean we want to see them in everything. No one wants to see characters survive so easily with plot armor. Most characters saved by plot armor don't even contribute or add to the storyline, just little ""hey thanks, you're now family because you helped me out, so you should survive/do well since the fans might like you"". Lucas let so many Jedi die in the original series but this series, it's special on being so unlikable for the Jedi. OG written Jedi are not this delusional with their own lives the way this show portrays. To the extent that implies we should buy and pay them for the idea of likable characters. They so desperately want us to enjoy every character just because they want to appeal to general public. Disney should've just stayed away from Star Wars.",3.0

",2024-06-05,"I was expecting something extraordinalily terrible, so it's a bit better.. what I actually did enjoy is the scenery and architecture. The buildings do look really star warsy. Unfortunately the characters and costumes are entirely the opposite... we have to watch some Matrix kung fu stuff in disney costumes... feels like a very expensive fan film. I could imagine watching some flythrough videos on the scenes with some epic SW music without any actors or dialouges that destroy the feeling. But again, i'm not disappointed because it was obvious it won't feel like star wars, i was never optimistic so it does not hurt..EDIT: nevermind, I wrote the review after ther first 2 episodes, now i know this is as low as we can get.",1.0
" A Disappointing Betrayal of Star Wars Legacy
",2024-06-18,"As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I had high hopes for The Acolyte, but it turned out to be a colossal disappointment. This series not only failed to capture the essence of the Star Wars universe but actively undermined the rich lore and legacy that George Lucas painstakingly created. It's disheartening to see such a beloved franchise reduced to a series of poorly executed episodes that feel more like a cash grab than a meaningful addition to the Star Wars canon.From the outset, The Acolyte's narrative felt disjointed and inconsistent with the established Star Wars timeline. The show seemed to go out of its way to introduce elements that contradicted long-standing lore. Instead of enriching the universe, it created unnecessary confusion and frustration among fans who have invested years in understanding the intricate details of this galaxy far, far away. It's as if the creators had no regard for the foundational elements that made Star Wars what it is today.One of the most glaring issues with The Acolyte is its handling of characters. Star Wars is known for its iconic and memorable characters, from the heroic Luke Skywalker to the complex Darth Vader. However, The Acolyte's characters are poorly developed, lacking depth and motivation. They feel like hollow shells, devoid of the charisma and relatability that have defined Star Wars protagonists and antagonists alike. It's challenging to connect with or care about characters who are so one-dimensional and forgettable.The writing in The Acolyte is another major flaw. The dialogue is clunky and often cringe-worthy, failing to capture the wit and gravitas that Star Wars dialogue is known for. The plotlines are predictable and uninspired, offering nothing new or exciting to the franchise. Instead of exploring fresh and compelling stories, The Acolyte relies on tired tropes and clichés, making it feel more like a generic sci-fi series than a genuine Star Wars adventure.Visually, The Acolyte also falls short. While Star Wars has always been at the forefront of groundbreaking special effects and stunning visuals, this series looks surprisingly cheap and uninspired. The production values are not up to the high standards set by previous Star Wars films and series. The sets and costumes lack the attention to detail that fans have come to expect, and the overall aesthetic feels like a watered-down version of the vibrant Star Wars universe.One of the most infuriating aspects of The Acolyte is its blatant disregard for the themes and messages that have been central to Star Wars since its inception. George Lucas crafted a universe filled with hope, redemption, and the struggle between good and evil. The Acolyte, however, seems to revel in cynicism and darkness, stripping away the moral core that has always been a hallmark of the franchise. It's a bleak and joyless interpretation of a world that has always been about finding light in the darkness.The Acolyte's attempt to introduce new concepts and ideas to the Star Wars canon could have been a welcome addition if done thoughtfully. However, the execution is so ham-fisted and disrespectful to the existing lore that it feels more like an attack on the franchise than an expansion of it. The creators seem to have forgotten that Star Wars fans are deeply invested in the continuity and coherence of the universe. Deviating from established lore without a compelling reason only serves to alienate the core fanbase.In conclusion, The Acolyte is a disappointing and misguided addition to the Star Wars franchise. It lacks the heart, soul, and respect for the source material that have made Star Wars a cultural phenomenon. By attempting to rewrite and undermine the legacy of George Lucas, The Acolyte does a disservice to fans who have cherished this universe for decades. If you're a Star Wars purist looking for a series that honors the spirit of the original saga, The Acolyte is not worth your time. Save yourself the frustration and stick to the classic films and series that have truly captured the magic of Star Wars.",1.0

",2024-06-08,"The Acolyte ditches the usual lightsaber clashes for a detective story. The main characters tackle a series of crimes, offering a fresh perspective on the Star Wars universe. The pace is fast, and while I feared at some point that the plot would fall into clichés, it hasn't and instead used them to hint at a deeper mystery waiting to be unraveled.The first two episodes fights sequences are well-done, hinting at more epic battles to come. The cast blends familiar faces with newcomers, all delivering solid performances. The characters themselves feel like natural additions to the Star Wars universe.Venturing into an unexplored era, The Acolyte unveils new locations, cultures, and characters, which is exactly what you would expect from a galaxy and timeline as vast as Star Wars'.I have enjoyed these two first episodes, perhaps even better since it was reveiwed badly by « fans » before it even aired. I'm giving The Acolyte an 10 out of 10 instead of the 8 I wanted to give it, to balance the trolls. It's entertaining, the mystery is engaging, and it has a lot of potential.

" A Waste of Time
",2024-06-18,"One scarcely knows where to begin with ""The Acolyte,"" a production that dares to masquerade as a television show. In truth, it is neither art nor entertainment but a sordid exercise in personal activism, thinly veiled and clumsily executed. The acting, if one can call it that, is appalling, evoking memories of amateur dramatics performed with the conviction of a damp squib.The plot, riddled with holes, collapses under the weight of its own ineptitude, leaving one to wonder if the creators themselves were deriding their audience with this travesty. To endure an episode of ""The Acolyte"" is to subject oneself to an assault on the senses, a punishment more fitting of some arcane ritual rather than a modern viewing experience. It is, quite simply, a waste of time.For those who cherish the noble art of storytelling and the rich tapestry of cinema, steer clear. This is an insult to viewers alike, a painful reminder of what happens when ideological zealotry overrides the essential human quest for truth, beauty, and yes, genuine entertainment.",1.0
" Not Meeting the Expectations
",2024-06-16,"Well, for me the series is struggling to meet expectations. The show feels overly ""Disney-fied,"" lacking the mature themes that define Star Wars. Its storyline so far has been simplistic and childish, failing to engage me with depth or complexity. Many scenes come off as awkward and out of place, disrupting the viewing experience. The pacing is problematic, with episodes dragging on without significant plot progression.The decision to kill off Carrie-Anne Moss's character in the first episode was theatrical but ultimately disappointing, wasting her potential contribution to the series. Overall, the series seems unsure of its direction, oscillating between attempted profundity and triviality. The characters are poorly developed, and their motivations feel shallow. The dialogue is often stilted and lacks the engaging nature fans expect from the franchise.Despite these issues, the show has potential if it can find a better balance between appealing to younger audiences and delivering the mature, layered storytelling that Star Wars is known for. Future episodes need to improve on character development and plot complexity to meet my expectations. For now, ""The Acolyte"" remains a series that is too Disney for its own good.I just hope the series will make sence after the week warm up episodes, if not let's keep this as a story for the children and expecting a better matured show for the genre of loyal fans.",5.0

" Awful, awful and cringe
",2024-06-15,"**The Acolyte: Awful, Awful, Awful - The Cringiest Star Wars Show Ever**Star Wars fans have long been accustomed to a rollercoaster of emotions with each new release in the franchise. From the awe-inspiring highs of the original trilogy to the controversial lows of the prequels, the saga has continually sparked debate. However, few could have predicted the depths to which ""The Acolyte"" would plunge. Awful, awful, awful - it's the cringiest Star Wars show ever, and here's why.From the outset, ""The Acolyte"" fails to capture the magic that made Star Wars a cultural phenomenon. Set in the High Republic era, a time period meant to explore the galaxy at the height of the Jedi Order's power, the show had immense potential. Unfortunately, it squanders this by focusing on a convoluted plot that feels more like a parody than a legitimate entry into the Star Wars canon.The narrative is a disjointed mess. It attempts to weave a tale of dark side intrigue and political machinations but ends up as an incoherent jumble. The protagonist, a supposed acolyte of the Sith, is a bland, uninspiring character whose motivations are as murky as the murkiest swamp on Dagobah. Her journey through the galaxy is filled with contrived encounters and ham-fisted dialogue that would make even Jar Jar Binks wince.Speaking of dialogue, the script is an abomination. Characters deliver lines with all the subtlety of a blaster shot to the face. The attempts at humor are painfully awkward, often breaking the tension in scenes that are supposed to be serious. It's as if the writers were trying to mimic the wit of Marvel movies but ended up producing cringe-worthy exchanges that fall flat every single time.The acting does nothing to salvage the disastrous writing. The cast, which includes some talented actors, is utterly wasted here. Their performances range from wooden to over-the-top, with no middle ground. The lead actress, tasked with carrying the show, fails to bring any depth or nuance to her role. Her portrayal of a conflicted dark side apprentice comes off as amateurish, devoid of the gravitas needed to make the character compelling.Visually, ""The Acolyte"" is a mixed bag. While there are occasional glimpses of the grandiose settings and epic battles that Star Wars is known for, these moments are few and far between. Instead, the show relies heavily on poorly executed CGI that looks more like a video game cutscene than a high-budget production. The choreography of lightsaber duels, a staple of Star Wars excitement, is lackluster and uninspired, lacking the fluidity and intensity that fans have come to expect.One of the most glaring issues with ""The Acolyte"" is its blatant disregard for established Star Wars lore. The show introduces concepts and events that directly contradict what has been previously established in the canon. This not only confuses dedicated fans but also undermines the rich tapestry of the Star Wars universe. It feels as though the creators of the show have a fundamental misunderstanding of the source material, leading to a series of baffling creative decisions.Moreover, ""The Acolyte"" suffers from pacing problems. The story drags in places where it should be exciting and rushes through key plot points that deserved more development. This erratic pacing makes it difficult to stay engaged, as viewers are either bored by lengthy exposition or bewildered by sudden, unexplained shifts in the story.In conclusion, ""The Acolyte"" is a colossal disappointment. It's a show that had all the ingredients for success but failed spectacularly in its execution. From the atrocious writing and cringe-worthy dialogue to the lackluster performances and visual missteps, it stands as the cringiest Star Wars show ever. For fans who were hoping for a deep dive into the dark side of the Force, ""The Acolyte"" is a painful reminder that not all that glitters in a galaxy far, far away is gold. Awful, awful, awful - those three words sum it up perfectly.",1.0

For example, seeing an earlier Coruscant was so stunning. The visual effects team is making a strong statement. Side note, I'm definitely hoping we see a young Darth Plagueis. 10 out of 10.

" SCANDAL!!
",2024-06-15,"I approached this series with high hopes, but after slogging through three episodes, I'm utterly disappointed. It's a colossal failure. As a die-hard Star Wars fan, it's painful to watch Disney mishandle the franchise so badly. The producer behind this should never be allowed near another project again. Who thought anyone would want to sit through this travesty? The acting is wooden, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the plot is so lackluster it feels like it belongs in a poorly written after-school special.Considering the vast and rich material available in the Star Wars universe, it's baffling that they chose to create something that feels like a subpar WB show aimed at teenagers. This series could very well be the final straw for many long-time Star Wars enthusiasts. The storyline is uninspired and fails to capture the magic that made Star Wars a beloved franchise. Instead of epic battles and complex characters, we're given a mediocre narrative that struggles to hold interest.The special effects, while passable, do little to mask the show's fundamental flaws. The characters are poorly developed, and their motivations are unclear and unconvincing. Key scenes that should be thrilling or emotionally impactful fall flat due to lackluster direction and pacing issues. The series doesn't even attempt to build on the legacy of Star Wars; instead, it seems content with rehashing tired tropes and clichés that have been done better elsewhere.It's mind-boggling that they squandered $180 million on this series, only for it to be something that a small percentage of the fanbase will bother to finish. The potential was there, but it was completely wasted on a show that lacks the essence of what makes Star Wars great. Fans have been clamoring for stories that delve deeper into the lore, explore new characters, and expand the universe in meaningful ways. Instead, we get a superficial and uninspired attempt that does a disservice to the franchise's legacy.If it were possible, I'd give it zero stars. This series is a stark reminder that sometimes, even with a massive budget, you can still miss the mark by a wide margin. Disney needs to take a serious look at the direction they're taking with Star Wars and listen to the fans who have supported this franchise for decades. This series is not just a disappointment; it's a disheartening indication of what happens when creative vision is overshadowed by commercial interests and poor execution.",1.0

Unfourtunately there are many mistakes and bad decisions about a lot of things: in my opinion the first mistake is to kill the best actor in the first 10 minutes of the show. The second (and major) is the cast choice for Yord. He alone is a very bad character totally displaced from the star wars universe, but the actor turned his character in something much worse. Lack of talent and empaty and lack of knowledge of the Star Wars universe certainly didnt help. But its impossible not to blame the producers and ultimately Disney for all of the bad decisions and lack of respect for the original material.Dispite that I still believe that the show can be better and improoved.

Amanda Stenberg suits her role, as does Dafne Keen. However, Lee Jung jae is a little stilted, and Charlie Barnett and Thara Schoon are positively wooden in their opening moments, and for Charlie it doesn't improve much.And it feels like the villain of the piece has already been revealed, I hope I'm wrong, as it would be pretty lazy writing to be able to spot it that early in to the first episode.The Acolyte's real problem, is that viewers have been spoiled by Clone Wars, Bad Batch, Ahsoka, Andor, Mandalorian and Boba Fett. If The Acolyte had only had to follow on behind Episodes 7, 8 & 9 of the Skywalker Saga, then if would be accepted as good.But spoiled as we've all been, this isn't a match for the other shows, at least not on the basis of the first two episodes of the season.",5.0

Dafne Keen , did she really need the work?looks pissed off as usual as in all her previous role's. Allowing for recaps and end credits, there isn't enough content to hold a viewers attention in nearly 55 minutes on average episode....

" Could have been good
",2024-06-12,"I did not look forward to this as the marketing pictures made it look like it was animated which is where I drew the line with Star Wars, otherwise watched everything even though Ashoka made little sense without the cartoons. First it looked promising but almost done with episode 3 and barely anything happened, especially the third episode could have been done in a two minute flashback. They had some good actors apart from the main character and had the money and the premise could have been great in the hands of those who made Andor. So far it has been going nowhere and it is really hard to care what happens next. Did the people who made this test it on any viewers? Who is this meant to be for? Not even angry like many of the reviewers just mostly baffled. The music also sounds like they asked AI to do second rate Star Wars show music and fed it all the other Star Wars show soundtracks without any of the catchy parts, only the filler.",5.0

" Is it a star Wars story ?

I still watching it as fan and as I don't have something better to do some hours of the week..

" A star wars show made by people who have never seen star wars
",2024-06-23,"This show is terrible. Not only do they not know anything about star wars, they seem to be actively trying to murder it. It isn't bad just because of their clear lack of respect for Star Wars and it's fans, it is bad because the writing is nonsensical, cringy, and just overall boring. Logic is thrown out the window in character decision making and nothing makes sense if you give thirty seconds of thought to it. Which is probably more thought than the writers put in. You will find yourself saying ""wait what?"" Several times during this. Don't watch this, don't hate watch it, don't waste your time if you are a star wars fan.

Anyways, it's cool for being in star wars and the acting is pretty solid. The story just sucks, doesn't make you want to know what happens next or feel a connection with the characters. It's almost like a selfish aspect, the story doesn't make your care or believe in what will happen next. Your just mindlessly watching until credits roll. Hope it draws my interest like how andor got me with the prison situation, that just blew my mind and I was hooked.",3.0
" Make an mediocre series and try to lure audience by naming it Star Wars
",2024-06-18,"I watched 3 episodes and with every episode felt like Titanic sinkin by the minute.The story is pretty much basic and poor, an ""acolyte"" that is not a trained jedi wants to kill 4 Jedi's by martial arts and daggers to revenge the death of her mother and all the other witches (that she killed by setting up a fire to kill her twin sister).A fire, a mediocre explosion kills all witches. With all that power that the witches have nobody used it to save themself.The basics of Star Wars, the battle Good vs The Very Bad is kinda lost and focusing on sex appeal, good looks and gender. Hair styles and looking good without a shirt replaced good acting. Say something and look good...
Acting sometimes reminds of bad sitcoms. The ""bad guy"" confesses and in a second everybody jumps out in the scene pulling out a light sabre and a recording device... We have your confession on a recording device.... So whats next,a Jedi saying hey google? Alexa? Siri?Why not use the classic Jedi mind tricks? No hardware or software needed.A regular Jedi doesnt pull out his/her light sabre until real threath. Pulling it out on an unarmed ""civilian"" shows a Jedi being an aggressive bully rather then a peaceful Zen one.Anyway, by my opinion the Star Wars in this series is pretty much in a galaxy far far far away...and by the looks of it it will become the new reality show Star Wars Lost in Space with nudes and sex scenes..",3.0

I hope that this will be the first domino to legend out the sequels movies as well. I can't wait for this show to be over and canceled and forgotten.

" All that's missing is Keanu Reeves
",2024-06-20,"Firstly, I think that there were some good parts about this, like the fact that it was fast paced and kept moving, so that I wouldn't have to spend any more of my precious time on this show. Another one is that there was Carrie-Anne moss in it, although she did do a bit too much of the matrix, there are actual lightsaber combat styles, and fighting styles unique to the Jedi, way too much was taken from the matrix, like how she ran up the side of the stairs. Is she not the one, and she dies??????The casting and acting was horrible, the Jedi were portrayed as some lenient and overbearing and honestly not like the Jedi that we are shown in the phantom menace, who are supposed to be calm and without attachments. Yet Sol, was acting very attached to the main character ( whose name I cannot remember because this show was not memorable ) immediately starts crying and shouting and having big displays of emotion when he sees the dead parents even though he was going to take her away anyways, which is like killing them off. Yord acts like a himbo and the stubborn stereotypical character who questions everything
Whoever was in charge of casting obviously put chatgpt in charge, and spent the humongous money put into it on the buffet table.How do you have a fire in SPACE AND HOW DOES ROCK CATCH FIRW!!! There were many many contradictory moments. SEATBELTS!!How do you randomly trust a Jedi killer to go on to a prison transfer ship and not escape??This show is mainly about getting more money money money and viewers, with minimal tie back into other shows. With boring dialogue and an extremely predictable script ( when I say predictable I mean I was literally pulling my hair out because I knew she was going to make a stupid decision and I knew what she was going to do), it was literal torture and Disney kept pushing its agenda( cough cough) I feel like it would have had so much more potential if we could have an interesting script. But don't hate on this show too much :)Overall, (I'm not a bot btw) I feel that if this show could have a redo, with more accurate and closer to the book story, this could be amazing.",5.0
" Sloppy, Sloppy Writing
",2024-06-14,"I wanted to like The Acolyte so badly. I've been desperate for a new IP in a new era of Star Wars. Given that this is most viewers' introduction to the High Republic era, I would expect that the first show of the era would be the best. Unfortunately, The Acolyte seems more like fan fiction than an official entry into the Star Wars universe.Episode 3 really solidified the fact that there is no clear direction with this story. Mae started the fire that destroyed the whole clan? Why is she hunting Jedi, then? If she started the fire, why are the Jedi feeling guilty for the death of the clan, enough to drink poison voluntarily? How did a fire take out the entire clan anyway, when the entire settlement is built into rock? An entire clan of force users wasn't enough to escape the fire? Another immaculate conception through the force? Somehow, this makes Anakin's life seem less special.I will keep watching because I love Star Wars, but this show is sloppier than The Last Jedi.",5.0
" Not horrible, but not good!
",2024-06-22,I'd give it a solid 5. The story line is silly. The acting bad. The dialog bad. The special effects are great! It has the old Star Wars feel. But its obvious they went out of their way to make white men an afterthought in this series. Which is fine. As long as there's a reason. But overall it's ok. I'll watch the season and be done. As I'm sure there will not be another. Thank God!Or thank the Force. Always been similarities between The Force and God. Which is why Disney wants to downplay The Force. Of course.

" This Star Wars series is a controversial & polarizing enigma. However it just started. Can it improve? This is a review in process. The series is not over.
",2024-06-13,"Overall there was hype for the ""Acolyte"" and some skepticism about it. As we watches the first two episodes of the Acolyte, our skepticism was proven right.Episode 1- (4-5 rating)
Some of the other reviewers are right about the Matrix references and the weak and iffy fight scenes.We are introduced to the assassin who quickly kills a Jedi Master (?) played by Carrie Ann Moss. Wow what a weak moment and a weak Jedi.We find out the assassin is working with a stronger power in the background but we don't find out who. Good.We quickly surmise and are told that the main character Osha is unaware of the killing of the Jedi when two young Jedi confront her.Episode 2- (4-5 rating)
Actor See Lee Jung-jae is Jedi Master Sol who saved Osha and taught her. He is convinced Osha is innocent (unaware that her sister is the assassin). And volunteers to go get her.We find out the lead character is a twin. Her twin Mae (also played by actress Amanda Stenberg) is the assassin on a revenge mission to kill the four Jedi who she blames for separating her sister from her on her planet.One of Jedi who was there (on the Coven's planet) basically kills himself with the poison provided by the assassin. Really? Wow. How easy a guilt trip can it be? He is meditating, has a force field around him that is in-penetrable by her, and yet he dies willingly? The more I reflect on what I saw, the more I am disappointed.Episode 3- (6 rating)The best episode thus far. The Coven- the mothers of the twins and the community of witches. It didn't get fleshed out enough so we get a chance to even care about them. Mother Aniyesha, the leader, of the Coven played by actress, Jodie Turner-Smith, is beautiful and intriguing. Her acting good.The contrast and conflict with her lover and other mother of the children is also interesting and mirrors the contrast and conflict between the two sisters. Let me also say that the two actresses who play the twins were quite good too.The writers and the director did a disservice to the story and the world-building of the Coven by killing them off to soon; or showing us that there were no survivors or were there? We don't get to see who exactly died. It wasn't revealed if the two mothers died; it was implied.The pacing is not good. It moves too fast. Everyone is dying and being killed by Mae. There are some good moments that get ruined by the writing and the storytelling. It seems like all the witches die by a girl (Mae) at the coven? How? How can the two mother witches die so easily? The dramatic conflict between the two twins is so choppy and abrupt that the story within the story gets lost.We know that the Coven is based of the Night Sisters or the Sisters of Darkness (example - Asajj Ventress) and yet we get denied that exploration.Disney overall needs to do better about quality control and giving TV series and movie production the opportunity and time to develop and craft better product. Disney in the last 2-3 years having been putting out lackluster projects like Ashoka, the Marvels, and. Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi; and the Book of Boba Fett.I fear that the Acolyte will end up like the above. I am hoping the episodes will get better, but like I said at the beginning, I am skeptical.It's not over yet. So if interested, join me as I review the rest of the series.Episode 4- (6 rating)
Yes the writing and the dialogue is mediocre. There are some moments though.And there's the make up and costuming. The makeup- the green lady who leads the Jedi? Come on man? She look like Shrek. I have to say that there are production moments in this show that is more like Star Trek from the 60-70's than 2024.The introduction of the Sith at the end. Very cool and worthwhile. Mae desperate change of plan is sketchy and abrupt- not believable; but her fear of the Sith and her love for her sister is realistic.How the Jedi are so easily beaten is pathetic. And unfortunately this has been a Star Wars / Disney trend.I dislike when the producers save the best of the story for the last 1-2 minutes. Baiting is for the next one. But I want to see.I am torn about my interest in Master Sol, Osha, Mae...Still not invested in them. Yord is unlikeable. Because I like the actress Dafne Keen (His Dark Materials), who plays Padawan Jecki, I am curious and like the dynamic between her and Osha.To me Episode 5 is the make or break episode of this series. If they get it right, then progress in storytelling can be made. They get it wrong, then there's no hope, in my opinion.",5.0
" Better than Kenobi
",2024-06-08,"Solid start, kept me awake from the beginning til the end, the coreography was fantastic, Dave Filoni should learn from this guys, the characters were ok, it was the complete opposite of Andor (slow pacing to deliver a gorgeous final episode from each mini arc). Here... I felt like it was rushed sometimes, we got the Jedi Master already dying from the beginning and she seems quite important and they already know in the first episode that the twin is the true culprit. There were some mistakes here and there like fire in space and Osha basically unharmed after a fatal crash but I still liked it overall, far better than Kenobi and better than Boba Fett, let's see what lies ahead in the next 6 episodes.",5.0
" Very good start
",2024-06-05,"I just watched the first few episodes of ""The Acolyte,"" and I'm thoroughly impressed. The visuals are stunning, and the writing is equally impressive. The fight choreography and world-building are top-notch, truly bringing the story to life. The master Jedi character is fantastic, perfectly embodying the Jedi figure.The show's exploration of the Jedi during a time of peace provides a fascinating backdrop that adds depth to the Star Wars narrative. I particularly enjoyed the intriguing mystery and the dynamic fight scenes that feel movie-level in quality.I can't wait to see where the story goes from here!",9.0
" Stop freaking out Star Wars has to be for kids too
",2024-06-06,"Okay, so I want to preface by saying that I grew up on the prequel movies. So I can remember when my favorite movies and actor, Hayden, were being criticized for a multitude of reasons. And I want to say that the hate pointed at these newer projects feels similar. Star Wars has and always will be as much for kids as it is for adults, and therefore I don't think its fair to criticize a project for feeling too much like it is for kids or having simple plot devices. That being said The Acolyte, in its first episodes, does suffer from some noticeable issues that do remove from the viewing experience. (Although I do have hope for the rest of the show, and the first two episodes weren't bad enough to turn me off of watching more.)The Good:
Sol, Sol, Sol. Lee Jung-jae has done a phenomenal job so far, and although I liked the cast going into the project he has been the only one in my mind to deliver a good performance so far.The set design and cinematography, even if done in cgi is some of the best I have seen from a Star Wars project in recent years. The choice of color palette for the High Republic era was exactly how is should be, with golden under tones and opulent looking settings. Even the Cantina looked fancy this time.Mae & Osha's dynamic has potential to work exceptionally well and be very powerful within the context of this story. I hope they delve deeper into their childhood in at least one future episode, as well as exploring Osha's relationship with Sol as Padawan & Master. Amandla Stenberg has done a solid job trying to do one of the hardest jobs in acting, playing twins, and her ability to hit emotional beats with those two characters looked very promising from the first two episodes. I am excited to see her in the rest of this and future projects.The Bad:
Choreography in the Acolyte, although clearly high budget, is totally different from any other live-action project we've seen in Star Wars. And although I appreciate the risk to take such a step, I feels cartoony and overdone. Although I did like the difference in fighting style between characters and how it matches their personalities.The writing is flat at best, and sometimes downright corny. I have no doubt Leslye Headland is capable of producing a good script, but she has put so much into other aspects of this project that the writing, especially in the first episode had me laughing in all the wrong ways. To me the fact that actors like Lee Jung-jae can do so much with this script shows how great they could be with a more fleshed out one. (I also want to say that show writing while keeping kids in mind is hard, near impossible. But good scripts can be done such as Avatar the Last Airbender.)
Lastly and perhaps the biggest gripe I have with the Acolyte is THE USE OF THE FORCE. We've seen in Disney canon, Jedi fighting and flying blind! In:
1. The original trilogy
2. The Clone Wars
3. Rebels
4. The prequel trilogy
And those are just off the top of my head. So WHY would Sol a Jedi Master be unable to at least sense Mae when she kicks up dust into his eyes? I has already been established that only extremely powerful force users could hide their presence at such close distances, the only example being the Palps in the Senate. It is small thing like this that has me worried about the level of attention Disney puts into their projects, but this is something that can be written off as a plot device so idk...Overall I want to say that The Acolyte is a project with potential to be fun for adults, and something that kids can grow up on and build Lego sets out of. But its not quite there yet. I think that placing this project among the Star Wars catalog is difficult given its disconnect from any previous show or movie, which I think is contributing to some of the backlash it is getting. Although a lot of the complaints are deserved, some are just sad 40 year olds trashing on this project because it isn't the modern Star Wars copy of the og movies. Just like they did to my prequel trilogy and SWTCW.TLDR: The Acolyte is Meh and that's okay.",5.0
" Ok Star Wars story
",2024-06-09,"Only based on the first 2 episodes. It's not as bad as the review bombs. I don't think it's true Star Wars fans making these reviews. I fast forwarded through the first episode as I found it slow after the first fight, but watched the second episode fully. It really isn't that bad. People making these reviews sound like the same ones that hated on episode 1-3 when I was a kid. Star Wars has never been big on the dialing the whole time George Lucas was writing them and this doesn't feel much different. It's another Star Wars story and people should give it a chance and stop hating because we dislike those who make the decisions over it.

Yet another copy-paste of all the copy-pastes, absent of any soul with the 3rd episode being already a filler full of pointless stuff.

" After 2 episodes: we will see...
",2024-06-06,"I want to give it a 5 but I want to be positive this time, so a 6 that can go either way.The scenes, settings, planets, costumes, ships etc. They all look like Star Wars, so that is nice.The dialogues are just as clunky as Lucas himself would write them. Episode 1 stuff.I must get used to the characters. I know that Carrie-Anne played in the Matrix. And I thought it was an inside joke to let the fighting look like the Matrix. But I see other Jedi do the same things. I like it that you see more of that side of a Jedi, but sometimes it feels more like ballet dancing then a real fightI also like that you can see better that a Jedi has a lot of power. But sand is their kryptonite I think... (weird) And I like that the Jedi are having their noses up the air. They know everything better and always have something wise too say back.I also like that they can put 1+1 together quickly. Not too quickly but also not dragging around. But still it feels dumb at some moments.I think also that some characters must still get into their roles.I do not want to go into details much because of spoilers. But let's see where this will go. The story is unfold, the pace is good, but if we keep chasing it will be boring quickly I think. But for now it feels fresh and new. It is not as bad yet as the Mandadorkian or Boobsa Fat and all the other forgettable Disney Star Wars stuff.For me Andor was good and I gave Ashoka the benefit of the doubt with a six. I think this can be as good/bad as Ashoka. Ashoka was more epic, Acolyte feels more like a side quest. But who knows...Update after 4 episodes:
Episode 4 was short, the story is still boring, the choices are even more weird then before. Still I get a Star Wars vibe from the worlds and aliens I see. That is why it is so frustating that the actors are not on their A game and the story is just... If you never read a book, watched a movie or series, maybe it could be interesting... Or maybe this is the new level for the new Star Wars generation of people? I do not know what it is, but it is horrible.Still I think somewhere that the story will be more interesting and it is a build op to something epic... But I have low hopes... We will see...",4.0
" So far, so okay...
",2024-06-05,"Nothing remarkable, typically beautiful production if a little samey by now, the sets are very reminiscent of Obi Wan for instance. The writing is again very reminiscent of recent Star Wars projects and the story so far very predictable, there may be twists yet to come? If so I'll amend my review but 2 episodes in nothing so far to be excited about.The usual crowd are bombing 1star reviews but I think we've all got used to ignoring them by now, it's a fair modern outing that has suffered from over hype.Overall, I love my star wars and Disney has done some great stuff, but the series are, for me, becoming a little over familiar, the much hyped change of writers, characters and directors hasn't done much to change things up.",5.0
" Feels Amateurish
",2024-06-12,"First review on IMDB, so I am sorry if this isn't written well.The Acolyte is the kind of show that would have done much better on cable TV. It's just pretty and interesting enough that you wouldn't switch it off until you hit an advertisement, but also wouldn't prepare your DVR for. In the streaming age though, I don't think you should seek this out when there is so much other science fiction (even just Star Wars) you could watch instead.The main issue of the show is the writing which feels very fan fiction-like in the sense that the events aren't very well thought out. The focus of the show is on emotion-explosions (again, something that is common in fan fiction writing).It's not all bad, it looks good and the actors are putting in great performances. The music and sounds are nice. It's not offensive in any way, in my opinion. It's just too boring to pay attention to nowadays, especially when compared to the excitement of the movies. The first episode started off well, though!",5.0

It's amazing to be in an era where there is no Empire or memory of the Empire. How will this lead into the later stories? Maybe it won't, at least not directly.

Plot wise its nothing fantastic, its still reasonably ok as murder mystery with Mae exacting revenge on the Jedi for some supposed transgression.Star Wars has traditionally struggled to write good male characters in the era of Disney but so far Master Sol has proven to be competent so far.

" Generic Star Wars Revenge Flick Lacking Flair
",2024-06-10,This show so far feels targeted to a younger audience with how the characters are presented and communicate. The plot of the first two episodes follows a fairly generic story of 'revenge' in a star wars skinned environment. The sets were good but not as intricate or immersive as previous Disney SW shows such as the Mandalorian or even Ashoka which were on very different planets making each feel new and different.The story is set well before the Skywalkers so the force is quite different and I would expect there to be new things we haven't seen from the movies. I have noticed acting of the younger cast is a bit off and forced. Dafne has had much much better performances but here she most certainly not exhibiting behavior and speech of padawan quality and acts like a teenager resulting in a weird vibe (like she is geeking out at the same time and unable to get into character). Lee Jung-Jae has really good English pronunciation that I was surprised only having seen his Squid games and he has developed his character really well and does make the show more interesting.Don't love it yet but don't hate it and am still interested to watch more. Feels more disney than lucasfilm and the story is almost laughably dull and feels inconsequential - as I watch I continue to wonder how much worse can this get. The story is barely developing and I'm losing interest fast on ep 3. Where we just get more background but no more further into any interesting story.,5.0
" I want to like, but it's just OK
",2024-06-20,I'm trying not to get caught up in the vitriol and hatred that seems to exist in many of these reviews and give an unbiased opinion. I think part of the problem with me and some viewers is that there is no connection to the OG trilogy like there is with all other movies and series. It's as if we're watching a new series with new characters so it's harder to get into a watching groove. I'm trying to give this series a chance but so far (3 episodes) it's ok at best. I'll take a break and try to watch the rest of season one when it's complete. If I had to rank this series it's definitely the worse of all the Star Wars movies/series. The IMBD rating seems to me to be spot on.,5.0
" Not terrible just meh
",2024-06-23,First off I have to say this show is NOT as bad as so many of the reviews claim it is. The show is set in a previously untouched timeline so there is a lot of flexibility. One thing of note is that the Jedi come off as morally gray. They go to the planet Brendoc to see if the cove is indoctrinating kids when the Jedi themselves take children to add to their ranks. Total hypocrisyI think many of the bad reviews are people just coping everyone else. Show gets bad reviews because they got bad reviews. I do have to say that this show is the worst of all the TV star Wars shows (Not as bad as the Holiday Special but I think that was semi intentionally bad)Hope it improves but not optimistic.,5.0
" Better than expected
",2024-06-09,"I've watched the first two episodes and it was better than I expected. Is it great? Is it with rewatching in the future? I don't think so. But it seems like this will at least be a good one-and-done series.What do I find good?The actions sequence are generally well done. For obvious reasons early on, I got a Matrix vibe. And the action continued to be top notch throughout the two episodes.Costuming is also pretty good, although there seemed to be some corners cut here and there. They were obvious.The variety of environments and creatures was also fun. But again, there seemed to be some corners cut on creature effects.What did I find bad?Unfortunately, the main actress who plays Osha/Mae is very wooden in her acting. For an actress playing a character expected to convey emotion through her eyes in many scenes, she simply isn't up to the task. You get one intense stare from her in most scenes. And to be honest, even without the mask, her facial expressions remain mostly one-note.Osha and Mae's hair... These two characters don't know the other is still alive initially. And they haven't seen each other in at least a decade or more. Yet the have the same hairstyle? And a distinct hairstyle at that. It seems lazy not to change up their look between the two characters at least a little.And that leads me to my last gripe. There's just no subtly or imagination in this series so far. So that makes me worry that they're more interested in getting to some end goal and didn't give enough attention to the details as a result.I'll hold it hope that some of these complaints are addressed as the series progresses. In particular, I hope Amanda Stenberg relaxes into her roles at some point.Overall a generous 6/10, but that will change if things don't improve.",4.0
" Master Jedi's Easily Picked Off by a Sith Trainee
",2024-06-13,"1st Episode - Jedi Master Indara, if she had the Force should have blocked the second knife thrown at her with the other hand while her focus was on the first one thrown to an innocent bystander. Makes me think she's the Newbie here.2nd Episode - Jedi supposedly Super Master Torbin, impenetrable to say the least and oblivious to his surroundings and from the dialogue revealed that he has not said a word for 10 years. And then WTF??? Suddenly opened his eyes after 10 years after being offered a WHAT absolution??? And a super Jedi Master fails to detect the poison in the potion. LOL.

" Y.A. FORCEd in to Star Wars
",2024-06-13,"This is a young adult show with a Star Wars skin, wrapped in overprotective inclusion blanket. I assume Carrie Anne Moss wanted to be a part of the universe and didn't mind having such a short sacrificial role... but having her so heavily leaned on her in the trailer and publicly to make it seem like she had a greater role was quite the bait and switch. There is some style, a little less substance, and a weak story that doesn't really fit. Suicide to assuage guilt by a Jedi master... REALLY! I worry that the show is intended to get new Star Wars fans and unintentionally abandoning most of the core fans.I will keep watching if for now that is why it is a five instead of the four I think it will end up being.",5.0

I just finished watching episode 4 and it was the best one so far. I can't wait to see where it takes us! It definitely started out slow but im really getting into it. People need to stop hating on the show and just let disney play this out. I hate to break it to everyone, but George Lucas is most likely not coming back. So why can't you just enjoy the new content and stop making absurd claims that disney is ruining the franchise. And yes I'm rambling on because it's making me add so many characters.",10.0
" 3 episodes in - can do better
",2024-06-18,"***SPOILERS***The series isn't complete and hopefully will improve but so far, this is underwhelming, despite having a promising concept and being unencumbered by the baggage of being tied to known Star Wars universe heroes.The acting is.... Ok? I'm struggling for the right words. Carrie Ann Moss as Master Indara has presence and does a good, if fleeting job but I'm not sold on Lee Jung-Jae as Sol or Amandla Stenberg as Osha/Mae. The only character I've liked is Daphne Keen as Master Sols padawan, Jecki Lon, who's main Jedi weapon seems to be sarcasm. I have no idea what Charlie Barnet brings to the party as Yord Fandar - it's like he went to the Joey Tribiani school of acting and I can't tell if it's the part or the person.As for the story, it's in development and there have been fleeting glimpses of promise, not least with the teasing of the Sith Lord for whom Mae is working. I get that a lot of ground work is being done to show character development, and episode 3 does the heavy lifting by showing the incident with the coven that brings Osha and Sol together and explains why these Jedi are being hunted but it all seems rather clunky. The real redeeming features have been the fight scenes, especially when Mae attacks Sol and his causal manner of avoiding attack as he does not want to harm her (and this is very similar to the attack by Mae on Master Indara) but it just feels slow and clunky.There are 5 episodes left and it probably isn't fair to judge the whole series yet (I wasn't sold entriely on Andor after the 1st episode but loved it by the end) but things had need to improve quickly before viewers run out of patience and turn off entirely.",5.0

There's something lacking in this series and well, I just can't quite put my finger on it...There are plot holes, bad acting, and modern ideologies inserted but don't let that deter you. I look forward to seeing how this story ties into the universe and hopefully explain a few mysteries.

" Barebone outline
",2024-06-24,"For a while now, I am working on my own idea for a sci-fi novel. Sadly, I am not very good and have difficulties to progress from an outline to a full fleshed out story. I have problems to write full three dimensional characters and dialogs a dreadfull. But since I am an avid reader, in my 50 years I read in excess of 5-6 thousends books, I have an instinctual understanding, when the prose/characters/story are on a level over the average badly written fan fiction, which I haven't reached yet.And the funny thing is, so haven't The Acolyte writers.I ignore inconsistencies in Star Wars lore, outside of most basic concepts fleshed out and solidified in countles books and movies. I mean a Jedi is a Jedi because they take the path of the highest resistence, and moral highroad. When they fall of the said highroad they stop being Jedi and become Sith. There is no room for any kind of ambiguity in this concept. And because of this simplicity, you need to do a lot of work if you want to add ambiguity, there are no quick and dirty shortcuts. But this is where my objections to the deviation from the Star Wars lore end.But not my objections to the story of The Acolyte. If you could call it the story.And here I come the full circle back to beginning of my review, why did I used so much space in review to write about my pitifull attempts at writing?Because for me, it is as if someone took my barebone outline of widely separated plot points, added my amateur attempts at dialoge, thrown away even my attemtps of minimalistic chracterization and said:I am done!

",2024-06-21,"I waited to watch a few before giving it a rating. Yeah, the internet is in an uproar, but Fandom is not the internet. And after 4 episodes I think I've seen enough to give it a solid five and try to point out two things that have gone terribly wrong.1. The creative team didn't include Dave Filoni. He's pretty much shaped the resurgence of Star Wars, and I didn't even have to look at imdb to know that he clearly wasn't involved. Which brings me to2. The tone is aligned with The Phantom Menace, arguably the worst of the 9 films. That alone is enough to doom it.But coming back to point 1: Lucasfilm, you've got the team in place to deliver compelling star wars content. Wild you wouldnt at least take their input on something so high profile.",5.0

Maybe Disney will lose enough money to make them return to trying to please the fans rather than just pumping out this garbage.Honestly it feels like everyone involved with this show has never watched Star Wars or actively dislikes Star Wars and wants to completely change it. Because nothing makes sense in the context of pre-existing lore. I'm trying to avoid spoilers but this show is a complete joke.",1.0

Also flash back or not how are you going to kill off Carrie Ann-Moss character? It has nothing to do with female characters or male dominant fans. Rey was main character and othe than Rian ruining The Last Jedi the other 2 were good. Anyway I hope the show gets better because Ep. 3 was horrible in my opinion.

" It is that bad...
",2024-06-24,"Do you remember when Star Wars was cool? It's not so long ago. Wearing a Star Wars t-shirt, for example, was cool. You wouldn't be caught dead wearing one today. I also remember when JJ Abrams turned down the third Start Trek movie -a universe that he had rebuilt- because he just couldn't refuse the opportunity to make Star Wars. What reputable director would accept to make a Star Wars film today? They would have to beg them, and they would still say no.Yes, Disney has killed the franchise, and the Acolyte is as bad as the reviews would make you believe.Let's get the controversy out of the way: the added diversity in casting is actually a good thing. It adds to the universe, makes it broader and more contemporary. The lesbian witches could also have been a good addition had the directing not made them so irrelevant (and yes, the whole ""coming out as a Jedi"" scene in episode 3 is a bit comical).All of that is good. It's the writing and the directing that are at fault here. You have the impression of watching episodes of Camp WikiWaka. The laziness and cliches of the screenplay are constant. One could almost dissect the show minute by minute to revel in the mediocrity of the writing (ex., to a supplier: ""start by supplying us the truth""). When writing is bad, filmmakers have to use directing to add interest to the story. None of that here, where every shot, every edit is only intended to deliver the lines with the minimal effort. It looks cheap, and uninspired.Nothing to see then? Well, there are three things which are interesting. The first is to observe how slowly technology evolves in the galaxy. The show is supposed to take place hundreds of years before the original trilogy, and yet the technology looks exactly the same. One wonders how they ever got to develop such amazing technology at that pace!Second, it is insightful to discover that life for most galaxy citizens was just as miserable under the Jedi Republic than under the Empire. Poor people living out of scraps in dusty, unsafe towns. No wonder people accepted the Empire so easily!Third, the Wookiee Jedi is a beauty. Don't you dare miss it. You will laugh out loud for days!",2.0

It's just not living up to the hype for me and definitely not groundbreaking...yet. I'm still watching and hope to be proven wrong, I don't believe there is bad Star Wars,but I find this very mid like Little Caesars Pizza, lacking flavor.

It all feels so contrived and forced.It's so sad that this got through whatever review process Disney has in place for these spin offs. It's genuinely letting the franchise down on a BIG scale. There have been some fantastic spin offs, then they curl this one out..I thought it was odd killing off Carrie Ann Moss within the first few minutes of the show, maybe i should have switched off then, probably the only character and actor that you feel you want to watch and that could carry the series. There is more wood in this show than you would find on Endor.Its not all bad though, the production, as usual is impressive, but you just can't get past the series as whole.

The Book of Bobba Fett was a failure and the Obi Wan show was a hit and a miss . Yes it was good to see him back and the duel with Vader was awesome , as well the young actress who played Leia but everything else was kind of mediocre at best . And then we had AndorAndor is a master piece . There is no other way to describe it . Everything from the script to the acting to the production value to the directing ... it was pure professionalism and just brilliant . There was just one thing missing . Jedi ! Yes as much I loved Andor I wanted my Jedi. And like an evil genie Filoni gave us the Jedi with Ashoka and good for this was so bad . You can tell that Filoni is an amateur . The show was just mediocre and was entirely about the poorly made animated series called Rebels . Everything from the plot to the characters was just sub par . Like I love Rosario Dawson but it was easy to tell that she didn't put much effort in the choreography and neither did anyone else . It was a show relying entirely on hype and built in audience and it pandered to them so she's it forgot to deliver an actual quality productAnd then we have The Acolyte . After Andor this is the only other show I would describe as a masterpiece . Every part of it is amazing . The fight scenes are top notch , the choreography and the actors are amazing . You can feel the sheer amazing skill of the Jedi in a way we haven't seen since that Darth Mail fight . The production value of the show is great and you can tell that real professionals are working on it .

" Fresh and immersive
",2024-06-19,"The latest addition to the Star Wars universe, ""The Acolyte,"" brings a fresh and immersive take on the franchise's rich mythology. This series, developed by Leslye Headland, takes us to an era set hundreds of years before the events of the Skywalker saga, offering an illuminating insight into the rise of the Sith in the last era of the High Republic.From the very first episode, it is clear that ""The Acolyte"" sets a new standard in terms of narrative depth and visual splendour. The cinematography is breathtaking, with lush planets, impressive space battles and a stunning attention to detail that will impress even the most ardent Star Wars fan. Every frame seems carefully composed to highlight the grandeur and mystique of the Star Wars universe.However, what really makes this series stand out is the depth of the characters and the story. The protagonist, a young woman who joins a mysterious mentor to unravel the secrets of the Dark Side, offers a complex and nuanced perspective. Her inner struggles and moral dilemmas are presented in a nuanced way, allowing viewers to develop a deep emotional connection with her. This is a refreshing change from previous Star Wars stories, which often take a more black-and-white approach to good and evil.The casting is phenomenal. The lead actress delivers a powerful and memorable performance that excellently conveys the complexity and vulnerability of her character. The supporting roles are also superbly cast, with talents bringing strong, memorable characters to life. The dynamics between the characters feel authentic and compelling, adding to the overall appeal of the series.The music, composed by a new talent within the franchise, offers a perfect blend of classic Star Wars melodies and new, adventurous themes. It adds to the epic atmosphere of the series and enhances the emotional impact of key moments.""The Acolyte"" also stands out for its innovative approach to Star Wars lore. The series explores the intriguing origins of the Sith, their philosophies and power dynamics, providing a deeper context for the eternal battle between the Jedi and the Sith. This gives fans a whole new perspective on the familiar conflicts and characters of the later eras.In short, ""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" is a masterful addition to the Star Wars universe that will delight new and old fans alike. With its in-depth storylines, strong acting and visual splendour, this series is an absolute must-see. It is a testament to the continuous evolution and renewal of one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history.And for those who are annoyed by this new series: my suggestion would be to write their own script and hand it over to the Disney - studios and until then make an effort to keep a bit aloof.",9.0

However, after seriously watching the first three episodes, I have to honestly say that as long as the subsequent episodes maintain the current standard, this will be an impressive Star Wars story.Indeed, the casting with a majority of people of color brings to mind the disastrous results in past Star Wars works (such as Reva and Finn, whose performances were lacking and overly emotional).

I'm sure we will see old characters as we have never thought of them to be and/or things will change them to what we know now!Could we see a Yoda...etc. Or we could see people thinking that they would not be born in this time?Remember this is Science fantasy and anything is possible age means nothing here!So let's give this a chance instead of dissing it in the very first episode!If it's not your Star Wars don't watch it!

The newest offerings are attempting to expand the Star Wars genre creating new concepts for the coming generation and I am one hundred percent into it! Even Kenobi which reaches into the past answers questions new fans may have about original Star Wars worlds and characters. Andor carried us into a new direction and that is a good thing.

But above all the director, producers, and writers need to manage, editing, writing a very strong story about the Jedi and the High Republic, especially these characters too to produce. I wish they make it good enough for us fans be pleased with, for suddenly it is not good enough for anyone else who is already complaining and criticizing this show online right. But except for me I don't and never complained and judged about all Star Wars television series and movies ever in my lifetime as a fan.",10.0
" Better than what other ratings say
",2024-06-09,"Maybe it's just because I'm not a Star wars fanatic, but me personally, I liked it. Sure, in the first episode, some lines were a little weird, but it got better in the second episode. Its definitely not enough to give it below a 6.5 overall. Definitely not on the same caliber of Andor and Mando but it still has wonderful potential. I love the incorporation of ethnicities, and how the backstory builds up and plays into the story as it goes. Yord is annoying and jumps to conclusions too fast, but that's the only somewhat bad character (at least my opinion.) I really like the show so far and I believe it needs more credit than what these other commenters say. Its definitely not so bad to the point where someone needs to give it a 4 or below.",8.0
" Women driven Star Wars prequel
",2024-06-20,"This one is an Interesting look at a lil' bit of Star Wars story line with a completely different look and fantastic sets to remind us.The SW universe holds so much more because it is character driven, ideals & values driven. Far out Cantinas, hyperspace travel, funny looking food that moves, colorful forests with flora & fauna to match, the Jedi's Universal Ideals that are so much more than cinematic and could feel part of everyday life. We could do worse than acknowledging twists and turns in originals and living with their values.We should welcome new prequels filled with new characters, new plots, new worlds, all presented with Lucasfilm's blessings, BTW!",9.0

",2024-06-11,"I rather enjoyed the first 2 episodes, looking forward to more, I like the development of both protagonist and antagonist characters. They both are quite likeable... production quality is great... seeing multiple jedi on the investigative trail was quite a treat and It drew me in...
The Acolyte and her off siders relationship and banter really helped humanise them, and made them relatable.Anyone giving this a bad wrap I feel might be the nekbearded, fedora wearing mouth breather variety. Star wars has produced something new and fun, the world is not collapsing, i think its a testiment to disneys efforts keeping relevent and bringing this universe i love to new generations.",10.0

Trinity is the closest they will get to a human female.I bet if the twins were male, they would consider this a valuable series. Like the Marvel seriest - these men only relate to themselves and then wonder why incels have no girlfriends.I bet if they went on a date and ranted about the injustice that the Acolyte is about women , they then would wonder why a woman didn't recognise their genius.",10.0

",2024-06-20,"First show in the High Republic era. Great look at life in the Jedi Order before the films. Excellent characters, funny droids. I love it.

The Witches from Episode 3 were fantastic and something I'd love to know more about. The Jedi are balanced here. Are they the good guys? Probably, but are their methods something that should be emulated? Maybe not. Watch and decide for yourself.

I don't see why all the die hard Jedi fans are so upset and so quick to trash the two episodes. So stuck in the past, that they can't move forward to the future. Allowing a new succession of characters to carry the Jedi into the future.

Props too to Dafne Keen from his dark materials and Logan. More favourites of mine. Plus we see the incredible Jodie Smith, I've never see her act before but she's fire and watch a beautiful woman.

I'm also very thankful to have a cast of characters with no connection to the existing movies. Keeping the Star Wars universe so small is a poor idea.",8.0
" Great show that tried to do something new.
",2024-06-19,"""Star Wars: The Acolyte,"" the latest addition to the ever-expanding Star Wars universe, is a bold and refreshing take that dares to diverge from the traditional narratives and themes we have grown accustomed to. Set in the High Republic era, approximately 200 years before the events of ""The Phantom Menace,"" the series offers a unique glimpse into the galaxy far, far away, focusing on the rise of the dark side and the events leading to the Sith's increasing influence. Despite its innovative approach, the show has been met with its fair share of criticism, often from a particular segment of the fanbase that seems resistant to any deviation from the norm. To put it bluntly, these detractors come across as grown cry babies, unwilling to embrace change or evolution within the beloved franchise.First and foremost, ""The Acolyte"" stands out for its willingness to explore uncharted territory. The series delves into a time period that has largely been untouched in the on-screen Star Wars saga, providing a fresh canvas for storytelling. This era is rich with potential, showcasing a time when the Jedi Order was at its peak, the galaxy was relatively peaceful, and the dark side was a lurking, but not yet dominant, force. By focusing on the machinations of the Sith and their shadowy rise, ""The Acolyte"" offers a perspective that is both intriguing and necessary for a more comprehensive understanding of the Star Wars mythos.The show's narrative complexity is another of its strong suits. It doesn't shy away from exploring the moral ambiguities and political intricacies that characterize the High Republic era. Characters are multi-dimensional, with motivations that go beyond the simplistic good versus evil dichotomy that has sometimes characterized previous installments. This depth allows for richer storytelling and a more engaging viewing experience, appealing to both longtime fans and newcomers alike.However, despite these strengths, a vocal minority within the fanbase has been quick to criticize ""The Acolyte."" Their complaints often hinge on the series' departure from familiar characters and storylines, as well as its willingness to tackle darker and more mature themes. These detractors argue that the show deviates too far from what makes Star Wars ""Star Wars."" This perspective, however, is shortsighted and fails to appreciate the franchise's capacity for growth and innovation.It's important to recognize that Star Wars has always been about more than just lightsaber duels and space battles. At its core, the franchise is about storytelling, character development, and exploring the human condition through the lens of a fantastical universe. ""The Acolyte"" embodies these principles, pushing the boundaries of what a Star Wars story can be. By introducing new characters, settings, and conflicts, the series breathes new life into the franchise and ensures its continued relevance in an ever-changing media landscape.The resistance to change among some fans is not unique to Star Wars. It's a phenomenon seen across various beloved franchises, where a segment of the fanbase clings to nostalgia and resists any attempt at innovation. This mindset is not only detrimental to the growth of the franchise but also undermines the creative efforts of the writers, directors, and actors who strive to bring fresh perspectives and ideas to the table.Critics of ""The Acolyte"" who dismiss it as straying too far from the original trilogy fail to understand that the Star Wars universe is vast and varied. It is not confined to the story of the Skywalker family or the binary conflict between the Jedi and the Sith. By exploring different facets of this universe, ""The Acolyte"" enriches the overall narrative and offers fans new stories to enjoy and ponder.""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" is a bold and necessary addition to the Star Wars franchise, offering fresh perspectives and exploring new narratives that deepen our understanding of the galaxy far, far away. The criticisms from a vocal minority of fans are indicative of a broader resistance to change that plagues many long-standing franchises. However, it is precisely this willingness to innovate and push boundaries that will ensure Star Wars remains a vibrant and beloved part of our cultural landscape. Instead of lamenting the departure from the familiar, fans should embrace the new possibilities that ""The Acolyte"" brings and celebrate the continued evolution of the Star Wars saga. Those who refuse to do so, quite frankly, are acting like grown cry babies, stuck in the past and unable to appreciate the rich, diverse tapestry that Star Wars has become.Hopefully Disney will renew it for another season.",10.0
" This show is awesome.
",2024-06-22,The new Chapter if the Star Wars Saga is awesome. It's adding mythos and expanding the universe of Star Wars. I am really enjoying the story being told. I like that it is going so far into the past and adding depth and context into how the Jedi fell and the path it took to get there. That they fell for their own hype and it caused their down fall. This show is showing how it all started. The writing is awesome and the story being told is new and breathes new life into Star Wars.

But this is not a dumb story for teenagers, it's a real detective story in the Star Wars universe. At the moment, after watching two episodes, I am very interested to see how the plot develops. And in general, I may be writing a bold idea now - it's high time Mr. Lucas retired, and his ideas, which were once impulses, need to be adapted and developed with the times. I believe that this format of the show can attract new fans to this wonderful world. And of course, it's too early to draw a general and big conclusion.I'm looking forward to the continuation.Vitalii, 42 years old.",8.0

While ""The Acolyte"" hasn't garnered rave reviews, it's worth checking out for Star Wars fans. The series explores familiar themes like good vs. Evil within a fresh story set during the High Republic era. Expect a slow burn with intriguing world-building and themes that resonate with the Star Wars universe. Don't be discouraged by the mixed reviews.

Introducing all new characters from a time before ""Skywalkers"" is a refreshing direction for the franchise and I hope we get more new and interesting stories like what I've seen so far in The Acolyte; stories that are no doubt Star Wars (visually and thematically), but break out of the shadow of the Skywalker Saga and all of its established characters. With that being said I am a huge fan of the OT and love, like, and at least claim all of the Skywalker saga (yes even 8 and 9). And as much of a Luke fanboy as I admittedly am, it's time for that story to be finished. It's time for more Star Wars like The Acolyte.",9.0

I cannot even believe people are saying the acting is bad. Shows they don't even watch the show. The only valid complaint I've seen is that is feels like fan fiction on a very high budget. That carries weight, but only because we are only 2 episodes in. Once we get to the meat of this story I truly believe this show will shed that diss. But we will see. Even if it doesn't get rid of that, I can only say that I cannot wait for the next episode.",9.0

Also the picture, location and creatures are very well made.

And trying to redeem them with a few that have a power, over everyone, call ""Force"" that protects some people.

The actors demonstrates great acting. Seeing Lee Jeong-Jae play a Jedi master is one for the books. I hope we get to see his prowess and masterful skills in upcoming episodes because 4 episodes in this far, his abilities has been lacking imo. It's intriguing to see the Jedi Order at the height of its power. And as far as the negative and bad reviews, it's a wonder how people are able to discuss the writing and the show in general when as of writing new episodes are still being released!

" Exceptional - Clone Wars meets Force Awakens
",2024-06-13,"I am loving this series 3 episodes in. The writing is sharp and nuanced. Characters are sympathetic and complex, with intriguing backstories and motivations. The world building so far has been quite good, if a bit backyard budget biome in places. As a longtime PT and TCW fan, it feels so good to see Coruscant again, and I love how this show is exploring the political intrigue and tensions that come with the territory, and exploring the themes that arise from inserting a powerful monastic order right at the center of galactic politics.Extra props to the creators for writing a multi-sided mystery while, keeping its secrets while holding both the characters and the audience on more or less the same page. Nothing is more frustrating than tension and conflict caused by misunderstanding, miscommunication, characters having incomplete information, or inexplicable bias toward forcing the plot in a certain way. So far the show is navigating this deftly while still managing to give each character time to breathe and develop in the spotlight. Well done!Overall, I like this a lot. The production feels slick, and similar to The Force Awakens, and aside from the few uninspired biomes I've mentioned, it feels otherworldly and just as Star Wars should. I can't wait to see where it goes from here.PS- ""reactions"" to this show have been the weirdest I've seen in my time on planet Earth. Hateful ideology has no place in a healthy Star Wars fandom.

Where are many flaws in the republic and the Jedi order which will lead eventually to its downfall. Yes, the original trilogy tended to be a simple good versus evil fairytale for children. But since then the Star Wars universe grew and has far more shades of grey between the light and dark side of the force. And so becomes far more relatable. I suspect a lot of these so called fans are just angry that their simplified expactations of Star Wars aren't fulfilled.

It takes some balls to fill in the gaps but the new characters are very interesting and whoever is the most popular will probably get some sort of spinoff. Maybe it's because I'm a super positive person but I haven't disliked anything that has come after the first 6 episodes. The acting of the girls is great, one is timid the other is fearless.

I think why most people are complaining about the show is because they don't understand that fact, and that during those times, the Jedi Order were very much different to the Order we see in the Skywalker Saga. The galaxy was also a different place at that time. I'm not saying the show is perfect but it is really good. The story is well written in my opinion.

Since then other tales have emerged and they do have a story to tell. They all contribute to the Star Wars universe. The Acolyte is a prequel.

The acting is fantastic, particularly Amandla Stenberg as Verosha Osha and Lee Jung-jae as Sol.

The service frequently advertises 6 episode or 8 episode series's, only for the show to have wildly inconsistent run times.

Besides the main character, none of the characters are memorable yet I'm only 2 episodes in. The action sequences are better than other Star Wars shows. The main problem with the latest Star Wars shows (besides Andor) is they refuse to create stand alone stories. Instead they make stories that only matter in how they link back to the original movies.

By the Acolyte I was very much positiv suprised. It fells earned and for the first time, we see a Star Wars outside the Skywalker Saga. I found the character development, acting, effects and locations great. The storybuilding makes me excited for more. Im pretty sure we will have many flashbacks in the other episodes to come. The only hope I have after watching the episodes 1+2 is that we don't see another reediming story - Bad turns good and so on. It is really ok, when a charakter dies. I just had too much of surviving from the death like in Ashoka.The Star Wars Universe has its own reality for sience. The Acolyte did not earned to be judged or spoken down because of the fire in space. Really guys?!?! If you really get annoyed by the fire extinguisher scene I think you should stop watch Star Wars anyways. It is fiction guys! Just imagine the opening battle of Episode III RotS without sound, fire expolsions and so on. Take it for what it is - A fary tale in a galaxy far far away!",8.0
" Don't listen to the fanboys..
",2024-06-22,A solid start to what has the potential to be a great series. Giving a bit more background to the Jedi order. Only the first three episodes have been released. Amandla Stenberg deleivers a strong performance and the action sequences a well done and engaging. I am hooked and I can't wait to see the season develop. Not rushing to judge something that hasn't been fully realized yet.Too many fanboys on here that can't wait to drop the scores of POC or female led series and films and boost up the scores of mediocre projects with their favorite white saviors as the lead roles and characters. Watch the projects for yourselves and then decide. Don't follow all these biased half hatched opinions. Happy viewing!,8.0

A more slow paced storytelling fans are used to compared to what have come before but you get a sense every scene and piece of dialogue is important to the overall arc of the story.

",2024-06-12,"Production values is indeed very good. This series works as a standalone and do not require other perquisite connections to enjoy. It's refreshing to see the first live action attempt in the Disney era that is removed from the Skywalker Era and one that doesn't need a ""I remember him"" moment to carry the story.I find the first two episodes offer enough excitement and intrigue for you to want more. Fight actions are awesome and a new take using angles & martial arts combination. It's an excellent start and something different from the normal Star Wars saga.Actors are great.

My favorite series of all time was Andor and this isn't Andor. However, I would say that I enjoyed the first two episodes and would like to see where this goes.Mae and Osha are compelling characters. There were surprises in both episodes. The battle scenes are compelling. This is a good example of Jedi power versus the dark side. I don't really understand the bad reviews.

I mean there is a reason Ashoka left. I Find the characters intriguing and would like to see and learn more about them. I also like the concept of twins, because I have one and how different twins can be from one another even though they're similar and how their stories can have very different outcomes. I also enjoy the new Jedi characters that have been introduced. Like Sol. Jecki Lon and Yord Fandar. I can definitely feel they'll be some great funny moments from Jecki and Yord because they're opposites which is fun in a team, and makes for some fun antics.

The reason why Jedi are being trained at 8 years old and not 4 is maybe because it's 100 years before episode 1 and that shes a force sensitive witch and maybe because of the events of this show the Jedi becomes more strict at training force sensitives at such a high age.

" Writing this after episode 3
",2024-06-12,"I've seen lots of hate centered around this show, which is sad because while this show is not perfect it is a unique, beautifully shot and interesting story that is still in its opening act. I think a blinding hatred has seized this community of fans and it is sad to see it prevent them from enjoying what I have found to be a very enjoyable show thus far. I see lots of people citing poor writing however this show is intentionally withholding information and offering specific perspectives to cultivate a later payoff (like do you really think Mae started that fire by herself and then decided to kill all the Jedi who did nothing wrong??? Obviously something is suspicious). The best shows are the patient ones that build up to their climax not ones that offer only formulaic storylines (marvel). There is still so much mystery to be unraveled and I hope people can look beyond hateful rhetoric and give this show a chance.Star Wars is for everyone but not all of Star Wars is for you. This is an enourmous IP and there is plenty of room for new and exciting things to be developed and added to this. If you love Star Wars you should want to see it grow and show patience and media literacy when it tries new things. If you as a fan want blandness and safe recycled familiar things then this is not the franchise for you (and that is ok!). Star Wars is a colorful and diverse galaxy and it is at its best when it feels that way. This show feels that way.While it is too early to tell if this show has the legs and the vision it needs to tell a cohesive and intricate story it is also too early to call this show bad. You don't have to like it but be open minded and give new things a chance, maybe you'll enjoy it.Thus far this is a good start in my eyes and I hope we are in for as many twists and turns as I think.

" what
",2024-06-16,This episode adds a lot to the lore of Star Wars. Unfortunately it's not in a good way since the jedi seem like terrible people and show no caring. This cult also seems very strange and this episode is filled with pretty much all bad people. That wouldn't be an issue if the jedi weren't shown as huge good guys in this show and also the ending is one of the most laughable things i have seen in star wars. The episode also isn't really that interesting with the set pieces like the ascension ceremony not being that good. The only ok thing was the generic sibling banter in this episode that makes it disappointing at the end.,
" Did nobody watch this first before releasing?
",2024-06-26,"This show suffers from poor writing choices, poor direction and poor execution. The poor writing choices have lead to many scenes where the only instinct is to open your mouth widely in disbelief that you just witnessed something so terrible and then slap your won forehead in frustration. The show was teased to be a mystery thriller with cool new actors/actresses we were waiting to see. Instead were left with a child having a temper tantrum, deaths of the most interesting characters and a backstory for a group of witches that their existence in the show was never needed. They could have chosen any set of twins in the galaxy whose family was in overtly affected by the Jedi. And with that grudge against the Jedi, they seek revenge but now we are stuck with an antagonist that that had one bad day and because they were told they were special they (against the laws of science) destroyed their whole community and blamed it on the Jedi for no other reason than they were there. It is a terrible waste of the acting talents of the main Jedi Sol, and that all the rest of the interesting character were unceremoniously killed off to advance this farce of a plot. I personally think the problem is that Disney gets so worked up about keeping the plot details of their shows secretive before release, that they don't preview them or get feedback, and so we are left to the whims of a show runner, a director or writers who can do whatever they want no matter if they are good at their jobs or not.",3.0

Acting, directing, and writing truly are bad. Watching a scene makes me think this is some fan created series done by amateurs. Almost as if this was all some big scam by production to get $XX from Disney and spend it on luxury cars and drugs, but certainly not on production quality.How did this show get released? Was there nobody at Disney that saw the quality was amateurish and horrendous? A few years back there was a New Zealand web series called AFK that was actually infinitely better production, writing, directing, etc. And this was a series financed I think that started as a Kickstarter or similar.

" Put it out of it's misery
",2024-06-26,"Weak Character Development:
The characters in The Acolyte lack depth and complexity. The protagonists and antagonists alike feel one-dimensional, with motivations that are either clichéd or poorly explained. This makes it difficult for viewers to connect with or care about their journeys.Pacing Issues:
The series suffers from uneven pacing. Certain episodes drag on with unnecessary exposition and filler scenes, while crucial plot points are rushed or glossed over. This imbalance disrupts the narrative flow and diminishes the overall impact of the story. Inconsistent Tone: The Acolyte struggles to maintain a consistent tone. It oscillates between dark, mature themes and lighter, almost juvenile moments, leading to a disjointed viewing experience. This inconsistency makes it hard for the series to find its footing and establish a clear identity.Lackluster Visual Effects: While Star Wars is known for its groundbreaking visual effects, The Acolyte disappoints in this department. Many scenes feature subpar CGI and uninspired set designs, which fail to capture the grandeur and immersive quality expected from the franchise. Predictable Plot Twists: The plot twists in The Acolyte are predictable and often feel recycled from previous Star Wars stories. This lack of originality diminishes the suspense and excitement, making the narrative feel stale and uninspired.Underutilized Setting:
The High Republic era presents a unique opportunity to explore a different time period in the Star Wars universe. Unfortunately, The Acolyte fails to capitalize on this potential. The show's portrayal of the era is shallow and lacks the rich world-building that fans have come to expect. Dialogue Issues: The dialogue in The Acolyte is often stilted and unnatural. Characters frequently speak in clichés or deliver lines that feel forced and out of character, which detracts from the authenticity of their interactions and the overall narrative.Underwhelming Villains:
Villains in The Acolyte are underwhelming and fail to leave a lasting impression. Their motivations are either poorly developed or lack the menace needed to pose a credible threat, resulting in a diminished sense of tension and conflict.Missed Opportunities for Fan Service:
While fan service should be used sparingly, The Acolyte misses opportunities to connect with long-time Star Wars fans. Iconic elements from the franchise are either absent or poorly integrated, leaving fans feeling disconnected from the broader Star Wars universe.Unresolved Plot Threads:
By the end of the series, several plot threads remain unresolved, leading to a sense of frustration. While leaving some mysteries for future exploration can be effective, The Acolyte leaves too many questions unanswered, which feels more like neglect than intentional storytelling.",1.0

Inconsistencies and plot holes plague the story and the actors look bored and uninterested with only few exceptions.From a massive budget of almost 200 million dollars, you'd expect the CGI, set designs, makeup and effects to be the strongest points of the show.

Ok, the story is supposedly set before the Skywalker period and well before the whole Star Wars storyline we know. I can easily relate to that. But to therefore write a scenario that appears to be there just to appeal to unimaginative children (and this is actually an insult to unimaginative children) is just a bridge too far. Not only is the storyline incredibly cliché and corny, but the direction absolutely sucks, the casting is completely lifeless and the acting looks like nothing.

" This show proves Disney pays for positive reviews
",2024-06-26,"The acting is the worse of any star wars film.I approached Acolyte with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. The idea of exploring the dark side in more depth, specifically through the lens of the Sith and their acolytes, promised a fresh take on a familiar universe. However, after watching the first five episodes, I am left more than a little disappointed.Firstly, the series struggles with its pacing. The narrative meanders, spending excessive time on scenes that contribute little to character development or plot advancement. For a franchise celebrated for its dynamic storytelling, Acolyte feels surprisingly stagnant. There's an overwhelming sense that the series is more concerned with setting up its next big moment rather than ensuring the current scene is engaging.Characterization, or the lack thereof, is another significant issue. The protagonists, meant to offer a nuanced look at those who align with the dark side, instead come across as one-dimensional. Their motivations are either underdeveloped or overly simplistic, making it difficult to either root for or against them. This is particularly frustrating given the series' potential to explore the complex morality and inner conflict of its characters.Visually, while the series boasts some impressive set designs and special effects that fit well within the Star Wars aesthetic, these are not enough to carry the show. The visual appeal cannot compensate for a story that lacks depth and excitement. There are a handful of good fight scenes, but unfortunately they're all followed with dialogue that feels forced and unnatural, lacking the sharpness and wit that characterizes the best of Star Wars. This not only pulls you out of the immersive experience but also diminishes the impact of the more dramatic scenes. So many scenes leave you questioning why they wrote it that way.Moreover, Acolyte seems to struggle with its identity within the larger Star Wars lore. It attempts to introduce new elements and expand on the universe's mythology, but these often clash with established facts, creating a disjointed feeling that may alienate hardcore fans. The series occasionally borders on retconning key aspects of what many cherish about the lore, which could be seen as a disservice to the intricate world George Lucas created.Star Wars: Acolyte so far fails to live up to the high standards of its predecessors. Despite its ambitious premise and the potential to delve into the darker corners of the Force, it falters in execution. I don't believe even future episodes can correct course and fulfill the promise of its premise. Acolyte is a stark reminder that even the most beloved franchises are not immune to faltering steps. If you didn't already know before this series, positive reviews can be bought. Currently an 85% on RT LMAO. Exposed.",2.0

" Political preaching getting in way of enjoyment
",2024-06-26,"The show is getting a lot of hate. There are lots of reasons not to like something, but the political history of the director and Disney have caused many fans to hate it when they saw the smallest political hints. Nothing wrong with a little diversity, but when a political group you don't agree with does REALLY OBVIOUS preaching, it causes some to freak out. It's not female or racial hate, plenty of examples of SW fans liking females and minorities, it's preaching. No difference than the other side freaking out if the show preached Jesus. Disney over-corrected the copied storyline of Force Awakens, and over-corrected the backlash against the Last Jedi, but they can't see the obvious problem right in front of their face. Disney used to be the best family friendly, religion friendly media on the planet. Now they are far from.And some plot points make no sense. Ki-Adi-Mundi clearly said the Sith have been extinct for a millennia. Mae convinced a Jedi to take poison way too easily. The witches (""we don't need no man to make a baby!"") were cringy, preachy and took the special-ness from Anakin. A fire in a concrete building should not have caused everybody to die, or caused so much Jedi grief. But on the other hand the overall story is decent, Master Sol, the tracker beaver, and the music are good.",5.0
" Darn
",2024-06-26,"So many flaws and holes without being aligned to Star Wars basics. And sheesh the script is so bad that the actors dialogues are brutal. Still watch for the love of the Star Wars universe clinging with hope it will improve. With episode 5 watched thankfully there was a lightsaber battle with good choreography, but that is the only good thing. There is potential, and no shade on the sound effects or the visual effects produced but the acting has not been even decent which is set up with the poorly written plot and dialogue. I do not expect the end of the season to be much better nor a season 2. Even the new movies are bearable but this spin off show is not worth the watch.",2.0
" The Sith have been extinct for a. millennium."" - Ki-Adi-Mundi (Star Wars: The Phantom. Menace)
",2024-06-26,I mean... I mean.... really like!At this point I'm just watching because I have caught up with everything else and I guess because i love pain too... lol! Also I'm going to continue watching because I love pain and I don't like to leave anything unfinished even if its this bad. But this is just really really bad... from the writing to the acting. And also Disney does what Disney does... I'll stick to Timothy Zahn books for now. I think AI has a better chance of writing something better than these clowns at Disney... but oh well unless someone has 65 million dollars laying around to take this franchise from Disney and save it... I have lost hope.,1.0
" TRASH... I'd rather watch The Last Jedi a Million times
",2024-06-26,"Disney's newest show, *The Acolyte*, is unfortunately the worst Star Wars installment to date. The writing is dismal, filled with plot holes and dialogue that feels forced and uninspired. The choreography is cringeworthy, with fight scenes that lack any sense of fluidity and have been clearly ""sped up"". Terrible. This show fails to capture the essence of the Star Wars universe, leaving fans disappointed and frustrated. Kathleen Kennedy, the producer, should be held accountable for this disaster. Her oversight has resulted in a product that tarnishes the beloved franchise, and it might be time for a change in leadership.",1.0
" It gets better
",2024-06-26,"Hated episode 1, average story, really stuggles, episode 2 got a bit better but then was let down again by 3.Acting is ok, but you get the feel they struggled to get into their role, not because of the actors, but I think because their roles were not that great to begin with. Sets & special effects on the other hand are top notch.After that, if you can forget all the bad implausable story stuff that got you to where you are in 1 to 3, from episode 4 it actually starts to get rather good, which is why I'm giving this generously good rating. I see lots of people giving it a 1, yet it's already way better than Ashoka. It doesn't deserve a 1.It's never going to be Andor, but maybe given a chance, it might catch up to Mando.Maybe.",8.0
" THIS SERIE IS GOOD NOT SO BAD AS THE FAN RATINGS
",2024-06-26,"I don't really understand the bad ratings except for the nerdy fan complains about leaving the true path of stars wars but i didn't think about that i just watch it and enjoy it. I have been there from the beginning of star wars and enjoyed the most movies and series but i don't feel the need to be an analyzing complaining nerd and only looked at this show as the good entertainment it is, good acting and god actors overall excellent performed and a good story with nice cinematic works and sci-fi effects so i like it as it is without judging it as a stray from the true path of star wars and see forward to the next episode.",8.0
" Watch first - then rate! Best new SW show since Mando
",2024-06-26,"I do NOT understand all the hate for this show. The characters are new and interesting (but also *gasp* mainly females and POC's), the fight scenes are really well done. The character development is good so far, and I'm loving the new and different story line! Amandla Stenberg does an amazing job with Osha/Mae. They really do an amazing job pulling you in. Jason Mendoza (Manny Jacinto) and Lee Jung-Jae really bring the action and suspense. Some of the Star Wars shows have been a bit lack lustre lately, but this show takes the cake. Looking forward to more episodes and another season (as long as people STOP DOWN VOTING). Give it a chance!",10.0
" This is NOT Star Wars because it is set 100 years BEFORE Star Wars
",2024-06-26,"I understand what you expected, and perhaps this is not what you hoped for, but give it a chance. A lot of shows are slow to get an audience because they have to get to know the characters. It is not fair to judge a show by its first or second episode and some not until half way through the series. They have to set the context, and this show is explaining how the context of Star Wars came to be. Just like Star Wars Episode 1, 2, and 3 showed us how Darth Vader came to be, this show is telling us how the universe divided between good and evil. You need time to tell a story like that. I am finding it interesting, and and hope the show succeeds. I am an old lady that has been a Star Wars devotee since 1977, and I am enjoying this show. Give it a chance. I found pictures of my family when my grandpa was young. It was weird, but when I looked long enough I saw a handsome young man that went through a lot and all the hardship turned him into a really wonderful grandpa. This is the same. It is weird to see how the ancestors of our favorite characters lived and made decisions but these are the people that resulted in our favorite characters. Watch it without the Star Wars bias. You may like it.",8.0
" It's hard to get into but wow it paid off in the end.
",2024-06-26,"Six hundred required characters? Probably as many Jedi as Qimir is going to kill. I have never seen any piece of Star Wars media that is so freaking brutal! The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, The Rise of Skywalker, Solo, Rogue One, Andor even, all pale in comparison. All hail episode five. My favorite thing about Star Wars is lightsabers and they gave me multiple colors, a huge group fight, actually well choreographed saber fight scenes. Thirty nine more characters, okay, we can do this.If you're doubting this show, stop it. Don't sleep on it. Get all the way to episode five. Trust me.",10.0
" Not what it seems- in a great way
",2024-06-26,"There is a lot of negativity for this show, but I don't understand why. As an avid Star Wars fan since the 80s, this has so much going for it. There is a lot of good acting, better than some other in universe projects. The writing is clever and the details are of what they are doing are very juicy for Easter egg hunters and lore masters of the franchise. Sure it's not as flashy or full of one liners and pew pew. It's more cerebral, and moves with a mysterious in a mysterious slower pace.It's rare to get a project that is something so new, and yet feels familiar. The set dressings, the aliens, the music, it's all so Star Wars, and all so new. It's exciting as a fan to not know what will happen next (as it's not shoe horned into the plot lines and character stories that we already know).I highly suggest giving it a watch through.",8.0
" Not even close to as bad as reviews say
",2024-06-26,"The way people hate on this show is ridiculous. I will say 1st 3 episodes were ""meh"" but I also understand setting up a story. Episode 5 has renewed all hope in the show. Giving us the best choreography of ALL Star Wars! Bold statement but it was all hands. Foot on the gas non stop. And the story progressed in a way that if given a second season will put it on top of most Star Wars series.The ability to show the flaws and how deeply embedded those flaws are in the Jedi Order, that we were kind of shielded from in the earlier series and movies, is unique. We're getting to see how time and time again the Jedi create the monsters they vilify.I can't wait to see the next reveal in ep. 6.",8.0
